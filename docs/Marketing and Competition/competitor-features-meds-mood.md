## KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR MYLIFE MYMEDS MODULE

1. **Medisafe sets the bar** for medication management with drug interactions, Medfriend caregiver alerts, and 90+ measurement trackers. Its shift to paid ($4.99/mo) creates an opening for a privacy-first alternative bundled in a suite subscription.

2. **MyTherapy bridges meds and mood** by combining pill reminders with a health journal, symptom tracking, and injection site documentation. This cross-functional approach aligns well with MyLife's hub model.

3. **Dosecast excels at scheduling flexibility** with unique features like time-since-last-dose scheduling, maximum dose limits, and timezone-aware reminders. These are differentiators worth matching.

4. **Daylio dominates mood tracking** through simplicity: icon-based logging, Year in Pixels visualization, and correlation statistics. Its 18M downloads prove that low-friction check-ins drive retention.

5. **Bearable owns the chronic illness niche** with unlimited custom symptoms, correlation analysis, and experiment tracking. Its factor-to-outcome correlation engine is the most sophisticated in the category.

6. **MindDoc adds clinical depth** via CBT-based courses and structured 14-day assessment cycles. The educational content layer is unique among mood trackers.

7. **How We Feel proves the nonprofit model** can deliver premium features (AI journaling, 144-emotion vocabulary, sound patterns) at zero cost. Its Yale-backed emotion science and completely free positioning create strong goodwill.

8. **Privacy gap:** Medisafe and Bearable store data on servers. Daylio and How We Feel are local-only. MyLife's SQLite-on-device approach is a competitive advantage across both medication and mood tracking.

9. **Bundle opportunity:** No competitor combines medication management + mood tracking + health journal in a single privacy-first, subscription-bundled module. MyTherapy comes closest but lacks the depth of specialized apps in either category.
