# Fitness & Outdoors App Market Research

## Executive Summary

The fitness and outdoors app market represents a $10-12B global opportunity growing at 13-14% CAGR. This segment spans three distinct verticals relevant to MyLife: workout tracking (MyWorkouts), surf forecasting (MySurf), and trail navigation (future MyTrails). Each vertical has different competitive dynamics: workout tracking is a crowded market with clear monetization paths; surf forecasting is a niche dominated by a single player (Surfline); and trail/outdoor navigation is the standout, anchored by AllTrails' ~$1B valuation and Strava's imminent $2-3B IPO. The common thread is that users pay for specialized, high-quality data and tracking, and privacy-first local-first approaches are underserved in all three verticals.

## 1. Workout Tracking Market

### Market Size

The global fitness app market was valued at $10.6B in 2024 and is projected to reach $12.1B in 2025, growing at a 13.4% CAGR to $33.6B by 2033. Smartphones account for 66.7% of market share. The market was significantly accelerated by COVID-19, which drove a permanent shift toward digital fitness. ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/fitness-app-market), [Towards Healthcare](https://www.towardshealthcare.com/insights/fitness-app-market-sizing))

### Market Leaders and Revenue

**Hevy** -- The fastest-growing pure workout tracker. Bootstrapped by two Ottawa founders with zero external funding. Revenue trajectory is remarkable: ~$20K MRR in 2022 to ~$240K monthly revenue in late 2023 to an estimated ~$500K MRR by early 2026 (roughly 25x growth in 4 years). Over 5M downloads with no paid marketing. Social features (following friends, sharing workouts) drive organic growth. ([Starter Story](https://www.starterstory.com/hevy-breakdown), [Business of Apps](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/fitness-app-market/))

**Fitbod** -- AI-powered workout generation with $20M+ ARR and profitability. Raised only $5.7M total. Co-founder Jesse Venticinque credits "maniacal focus on product retention" for growing largely on revenue alone. 10M+ users, 40M+ logged workouts. Subscription at $12.99/mo. Demonstrates that a focused, profitable fitness app can reach meaningful scale without heavy VC funding. ([RevenueCat Podcast](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/podcast-jesse-venticinque/), [Fitbod](https://fitbod.me/about/))

**Strong App** -- Clean, focused workout logger with 3M+ users and a consistent 4.9-star rating. Popular with the lifting community for its no-nonsense UX. Subscription model. Specific revenue figures are private but the app consistently ranks in the top 10 fitness apps on both stores.

**JEFIT** -- Veteran player with 12M+ users and a massive exercise database. Named Best Fitness App of 2024 (Men's Health, PC Magazine). Subscription at $12.99/mo or $69.99/yr. Community-driven with shared workout routines. ([JEFIT](https://www.jefit.com/))

**StrongLifts 5x5** -- Built around the classic beginner barbell program. Free basics with pro paywall. Popular gateway app for new lifters, though limited to one training methodology.

### Platform Players (Free/Bundled)

**Nike Training Club** -- Removed its premium paywall during COVID, making all 185+ workouts free. This drove a 60% surge in active users but eliminated direct monetization. Functions primarily as a brand marketing vehicle for Nike rather than a revenue product. ([Nike](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app))

**Gymshark Training** -- Entirely free, no ads. Similar brand marketing strategy to NTC. Provides a workout library filtered by type, duration, body part, and equipment. Users benefit, but the app exists to drive apparel sales.

**Apple Fitness+** -- 4.1M monthly active users (Q1 2025). 8,000+ workouts and meditations in 4K. Expanded to 28 new countries in 2025. Integrated with Strava. Bundled with Apple One, making it difficult to assess standalone willingness-to-pay. The platform advantage (deep Apple Watch integration) is its moat. ([Apple Newsroom](https://www.apple.com/cm/newsroom/2026/01/2025-marked-a-record-breaking-year-for-apple-services/))

### Peloton Public Financials (PTON)

Peloton is the cautionary tale of the fitness app market, and its public financials reveal the sector's volatility:

| Metric | FY2024 | FY2025 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $2.71B | $2.49B | -7.8% |
| Connected Fitness Subs | 2.98M | ~2.88M (guided) | -3.4% |
| Net Income | Loss | $21.6M (Q4 profit) | Turnaround |
| Free Cash Flow | -- | $320M | Positive |
| Market Cap (Feb 2026) | -- | ~$1.8B | -- |
| Stock Price (Feb 2026) | -- | ~$4.08 | -28.6% YoY |

Key context: Peloton peaked at a $50B market cap in January 2021 during the COVID fitness boom and has since lost ~96% of its value. The company cut $200M in expenses in FY2025 and plans another $100M in FY2026. It finally posted a quarterly profit ($21.6M in Q4 2024) and generated $320M in free cash flow. The turnaround is underway but revenue continues declining. ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/peloton-pton-earnings-q4-2024.html), [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/pton/revenue/), [MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PTON/peloton-interactive/market-cap))

**Lesson for MyLife:** Peloton's collapse illustrates the risk of hardware-dependent fitness models. Software-only, privacy-first approaches (like MyWorkouts) avoid the hardware trap entirely. Peloton's app-only subscription ($12.99/mo) competes with apps 10x cheaper, suggesting the market is price-sensitive at the premium end.

### Workout Tracking Competitive Landscape

The workout tracking space is crowded but fragmented. No single app dominates the way Surfline dominates surf. Key dynamics:

1. **Social features drive growth.** Hevy's zero-paid-marketing growth is powered by social sharing. Strava's community is its moat.
2. **AI differentiation is emerging.** Fitbod leads with AI-generated workouts. This is a defensible advantage if the recommendations are meaningfully better.
3. **Retention is everything.** Fitbod's $20M ARR on $5.7M raised proves that retention-focused products outperform growth-hacking approaches.
4. **Free platforms suppress pricing.** NTC, Gymshark, and Apple Fitness+ being free/bundled creates downward pricing pressure on workout apps.

## 2. Surf Forecasting Market (Niche)

### Market Context

Surf forecasting is a small, specialized niche within the broader sports/weather app category. The global surfing population is estimated at 23-35 million active surfers, with the US (particularly California and Hawaii) being the largest market.

### Surfline Dominance

Surfline operates as a near-monopoly in surf forecasting:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | 5.5M+ |
| Monthly Active Users | 3M+ |
| Monthly Website Visits | 10M+ |
| Total Funding | $42.8M |
| Estimated Revenue | ~$29M/yr |
| Premium Pricing | $15.99/mo or $119.99/yr (2025) |
| Premium with Ads | $69.99/yr |
| Global Spot Coverage | 5,000+ |
| Camera Network | 900+ live cams |

Surfline acquired MagicSeaweed in 2017 (not 2022 as sometimes reported), consolidating the two largest English-language surf forecast platforms. This acquisition eliminated the primary competitor and gave Surfline global coverage. MagicSeaweed's Pro subscription was $40/yr at the time, and Surfline has since raised prices to $119.99/yr for the full premium tier. ([Surfline](https://www.surfline.com/), [Boardsport SOURCE](https://www.boardsportsource.com/newsletter/magicseaweed-acquired-surfline/))

The 2025 CEO letter outlined plans for reimagined forecaster content and expanded media sharing, aiming to deepen community engagement as the company celebrates its 40th anniversary. ([Surfline Blog](https://www.surfline.com/surf-news/looking-back-2024-letter-ceo/214405))

### Other Players

**Windy.app** -- Weather-first platform serving surfers, sailors, and fishers. 3M+ users, 50M+ total downloads across platforms. Estimated ~$700K monthly revenue (~$8.4M annually). Pricing ranges $5-15/mo for premium tiers. Windy competes on breadth (multi-sport weather) rather than surf-specific depth. ([Windy.app](https://windy.app/))

**NOAA Surf** -- Free government data (buoy readings, swell models). The raw data source that Surfline and others build upon. No UX, no spot-specific forecasts, no cameras. Serves as the commodity baseline.

**Surf News Network / The Inertia** -- Content/media platforms, not forecast tools. Minimal competitive overlap with MySurf's core product.

### MySurf Opportunity

Surfline's near-monopoly creates a classic disruption opportunity:

1. **Price sensitivity.** Surfline raised prices to $119.99/yr and $15.99/mo. Community backlash is visible on forums. A high-quality alternative at a lower price point has room.
2. **Camera lock-in is the moat.** Surfline's 900+ camera network is its true competitive advantage. A new entrant cannot replicate this easily. MySurf's AI-narrative approach and data-driven forecasting offer differentiation without requiring camera infrastructure.
3. **Privacy gap.** Surfline collects significant user data. A privacy-first alternative aligns with a growing user preference.
4. **Niche market ceiling.** With ~35M surfers globally and ~5.5M Surfline users, the addressable market is inherently small. At $5-8/mo, the TAM for surf apps is roughly $200-350M. This is a viable lifestyle business but not a venture-scale market on its own.

## 3. Trail & Outdoor Activity Market

### Market Size

The hiking apps market was valued at $370M-$1.2B in 2024 (estimates vary by methodology), projected to grow at 8.9-13.1% CAGR. US hiking participation hit an all-time high of 57.8M Americans in 2023, up 16.3% since 2019. North America represents ~38% of the global hiking app market. ([Business Research Insights](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/hiking-apps-market-119884), [American Trails](https://www.americantrails.org/resources/outdoor-participation-trends-report-2024))

### AllTrails: The $750M+ Outdoor Platform

AllTrails is the defining success story in outdoor apps:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Registered Users | 60M+ |
| Paying Subscribers | 1M+ |
| Revenue (2023) | $37.9M |
| Total Funding | $228M |
| Key Investor | Permira ($150M growth, 2021) |
| Estimated Valuation | ~$750M-1B |
| Premium Pricing | $35.99/yr |
| Trail Database | 200,000+ |
| Countries Covered | 190 |
| Awards | Apple App of the Year 2023 |

AllTrails' 130% YoY growth in daily active users around the Permira investment, combined with its Apple App of the Year recognition in 2023, demonstrate the massive latent demand for outdoor recreation apps. The conversion rate (1M+ paid out of 60M+ registered, ~1.7%) suggests significant monetization upside similar to Strava's dynamic. ([GetLatka](https://getlatka.com/companies/alltrails), [Permira](https://www.permira.com/news-and-insights/announcements/alltrails-raises-150-million-investment-led-by-permira))

**What the valuation tells us:** At ~$750M-1B on ~$38M revenue, AllTrails trades at roughly 20-26x revenue. This premium reflects the massive user base (60M+), strong engagement metrics, and the post-COVID outdoor participation trend. It validates that a focused, well-executed outdoor app can achieve near-unicorn status.

### Strava: IPO at $2-3B

Strava represents the largest upcoming liquidity event in fitness/outdoor tech:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | 180M+ |
| Revenue (2025 est.) | ~$500M ARR |
| Paid Subscribers | ~4-9M (2-5% conversion) |
| Pricing | $11.99/mo, $79.99/yr |
| Last Valuation | $2.2B (Series F, May 2025) |
| IPO Target | $2-3B (Spring 2026) |
| Revenue Sources | 90% subscriptions |
| YoY Growth | ~50% (2025 vs 2024) |

Strava filed confidentially for IPO in January 2026 with Goldman Sachs as lead underwriter. The filing revealed ~50% YoY revenue growth in 2025, approaching $500M ARR. With only 2-5% of users paying, Strava's monetization upside is enormous. The platform's social graph (segments, clubs, kudos) creates strong network effects that are nearly impossible to replicate. ([Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/01/13/how-strava-ran-toward-a-comeback-ipo/), [The 5K Runner](https://the5krunner.com/2026/01/09/strava-ipo-filing-3-billion-valuation-analysis/), [PYMNTS](https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2025/strava-prepares-to-launch-ipo-as-soon-as-early-2026/))

**What the IPO tells us:** Strava at $2-3B on ~$500M revenue implies a 4-6x revenue multiple, much lower than AllTrails' ~25x. This likely reflects Strava's maturity and the market's skepticism about further growth in paid conversion. Still, $500M ARR from a fitness/outdoor tracking app proves the market supports massive subscription businesses in this space.

### Komoot: Acquired for $?? by Bending Spoons

Komoot (40M+ users, ~$38M estimated revenue) was acquired by Bending Spoons in March 2025. Bending Spoons is known for acquiring consumer apps (Evernote, Meetup, StreamYard) and aggressively optimizing them for profitability. The acquisition price was not disclosed but Komoot's user base and European market position make it a significant outdoor platform. ([Komoot Newsroom](https://newsroom.komoot.com/238612-komoot-breaks-the-40-million-mark-for-registered-users/))

### Other Trail Players

**Gaia GPS** -- Acquired by Outside Inc., now bundled into the $40/yr Outside+ subscription. Specialized in backcountry navigation with detailed topo maps. Used by search and rescue teams, firefighters, and serious backcountry users. Positioning has shifted from standalone to bundled, which may erode its identity.

**Wikiloc** -- 16M users, 60M trails. Strong in Europe and South America. Priced at ~$20/yr. Community-driven with user-contributed trail data. Less polished than AllTrails but deeper in international coverage.

## Key Takeaways for MyLife

### 1. MyWorkouts Positioning
The workout tracking market is crowded but the winning formula is clear: **retention-first product + social features + AI differentiation**. Hevy's bootstrapped trajectory ($0 funding to ~$6M ARR) and Fitbod's profitable $20M ARR prove that focused, well-built workout trackers can succeed without massive funding. MyWorkouts should differentiate on privacy (no data harvesting), offline-first (unlike Hevy/Fitbod which require accounts), and Supabase-powered optional sync for cross-device users.

**Pricing benchmark:** $4.99-9.99/mo or $29.99-59.99/yr is the sweet spot. The free tier from NTC/Gymshark/Apple creates a floor, and Peloton's $12.99 is a ceiling that few indie apps can justify.

### 2. MySurf Positioning
Surfline's near-monopoly and recent price increases ($119.99/yr) create a clear disruption window. MySurf's AI-narrative approach offers genuine differentiation without requiring Surfline's expensive camera infrastructure. The niche market (TAM ~$200-350M) limits venture-scale ambitions but is ideal for a lifestyle module within a suite subscription.

**Pricing benchmark:** $5-8/mo standalone or included in MyLife Pro ($4.99/mo) would significantly undercut Surfline while delivering high perceived value.

### 3. MyTrails Opportunity (Future Module)
The AllTrails valuation (~$1B on $38M revenue) and Strava's IPO filing (~$3B on $500M revenue) validate that outdoor recreation apps can achieve massive scale. A privacy-first trail tracking module with offline maps and no account requirement would differentiate from AllTrails (which requires an account and collects usage data). The post-COVID outdoor participation trend (57.8M US hikers, up 16.3%) provides strong tailwinds.

**Pricing benchmark:** $2.99/mo standalone or included in MyLife Pro. AllTrails at $35.99/yr sets the ceiling for trail-only apps.

### 4. Suite Advantage
MyLife's greatest competitive advantage across all three verticals is the **suite bundling model**. Users currently pay:
- Strava: $79.99/yr
- Surfline: $119.99/yr
- AllTrails: $35.99/yr
- Fitbod: $155.88/yr ($12.99/mo)

**Total: ~$391/yr** for four separate apps with four accounts, four data silos, and zero interoperability.

MyLife Pro at $29.99/yr ($4.99/mo) delivers workout tracking, surf forecasting, and trail navigation (plus 7 other modules) in a single privacy-first app with unified local storage. The value proposition is approximately **13x more value per dollar** than buying competitors individually. This is the core narrative for MyLife's fitness and outdoors positioning.

### 5. Market Risks
- **Platform risk:** Apple Fitness+ bundling with Apple One could expand into tracking/outdoor features, compressing the market from above.
- **Strava network effects:** Strava's social graph (180M users) is a moat that no single competitor can replicate. MyWorkouts should not try to compete on social, but rather on privacy and data ownership.
- **AllTrails content moat:** 200,000+ trails with reviews and photos represent years of community contribution. A new trail app needs a strategy for content bootstrapping (e.g., OpenStreetMap, public land data).
- **Peloton's cautionary tale:** The fitness app market is cyclical. COVID drove unsustainable growth that has since reversed. Building for sustainable, retention-driven growth (Fitbod model) is safer than growth-at-all-costs (Peloton model).
