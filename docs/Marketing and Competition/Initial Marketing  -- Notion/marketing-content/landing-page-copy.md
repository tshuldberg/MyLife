## Problem Section

### The App Subscription Tax

You didn't notice it happening. One app at a time, $5 here, $12 there, $15 over there. Now you're spending $100+ a month on apps that track your budget, your workouts, your reading, your fasting, your mood, your medication, your sleep, and your habits.

Here's what the average power user pays:

| App | What it does | Annual cost |
|-----|-------------|------------|
| YNAB | Budget tracking | $109/yr |
| Surfline | Surf forecasts | $120/yr |
| Strava | Workout tracking | $80/yr |
| Zero Plus | Fasting tracker | $70/yr |
| Calm | Meditation | $70/yr |
| MyFitnessPal | Calorie counting | $200/yr |
| StoryGraph Plus | Book tracking | $50/yr |
| Daylio | Mood tracking | $36/yr |
| Habitify | Habit tracking | $30/yr |
| Notion | Notes | $96/yr |
| **Total** | **10 apps** | **$861/yr** |

That's $4,305 over five years. For apps that store your personal data on their servers, sell it to partners, change their privacy policies without asking, and raise prices whenever they want.

YNAB went from $50/year to $109/year. Surfline went from $60 to $120. MyFitnessPal was hacked, exposing 150 million accounts. Mint shut down entirely and funneled users to Credit Karma. Evernote laid off its entire staff after acquisition. Dictionary.com deleted all user accounts.

You're renting. And the landlords keep raising rent.

## Privacy Section

### Your Data Architecture

Other apps say "we take privacy seriously" in 4,000-word policies full of exceptions. Here's our privacy policy in one sentence:

**We never have your data.**

MyLife stores everything in a single SQLite database file on your device. There is no server to store data on. There is no account to create. There is no analytics SDK phoning home. There is no Plaid connecting to your bank. There is no cloud sync uploading your files.

Your budget numbers, workout logs, reading history, fasting records, mood entries, medication schedules, cycle data, journal entries, and every other piece of personal information exist in exactly one place: your phone.

We can't see it. We can't sell it. We can't lose it in a breach. We can't hand it over to a government. We can't change our privacy policy to allow new uses. Because we never touch it.

**What does this mean in practice?**

- MyFitnessPal was hacked in 2018, exposing 150 million accounts. MyLife has no accounts to hack.
- Flo Health stores 380 million users' cycle data on their servers. MyCycle stores cycle data on your phone only.
- Medisafe shares medication data with pharmaceutical partners. MyMeds has zero pharma partnerships and zero server-side data.
- Mint shut down and redirected users to Credit Karma. MyLife can't redirect your data anywhere. It's on your phone.
- YNAB stores your complete financial picture on their cloud. MyBudget stores it in a SQLite file you fully control.

**Export anytime.** Your data is yours. Export as CSV, JSON, or Markdown whenever you want. No lock-in. No "please contact support to request your data." It's a file on your phone. Copy it.

## FAQ Copy (for expandable section)

**Do I need an account?**
No. MyLife requires no account, no email, no sign-up. Download, buy what you want, start using it.

**What happens when you add new modules?**
If you bought the Complete Suite ($20), new modules are included automatically at no extra cost. If you bought individual modules, new ones cost $2 each.

**How do I get my data out?**
Every module supports export to CSV, JSON, or Markdown. It's a local file on your device. You can copy it anytime.

**Can I sync across devices?**
Most modules are local-only by design. Some modules (MySurf, MyWorkouts) offer optional Supabase sync for cross-device use. Local-first is the default; sync is opt-in.

**What if I switch phones?**
Your data is in a standard SQLite file. Transfer it to your new device like any other file. We provide transfer instructions for iOS and Android.

**How do you make money without subscriptions?**
One-time purchases. Our costs are low because we don't run servers, don't pay for cloud infrastructure, don't license third-party APIs for bank linking, and don't employ data engineers to manage user databases. The marginal cost of an additional user is effectively zero.

**Why should I trust you?**
Because trust isn't required. We architected the system so you don't have to trust us. Your data never leaves your device. We can't access it even if we wanted to. There's nothing to trust because there's nothing we can do with data we don't have.

**Is this too good to be true?**
No. It's the same model that Anki (iOS, $25, ~$10.8M/year), Streaks ($5, Apple Design Award), and Paprika ($5, cult following) have proven works. One-time purchase, sustainable business. We just do it with 20+ apps instead of one.
