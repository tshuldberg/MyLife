### H1: MyLife vs YNAB: Envelope Budgeting for $2 Instead of $109/Year

You love the envelope method. You hate that it costs $109/year.

YNAB (You Need A Budget) pioneered zero-based budgeting for consumers and built a near-religious following around the "give every dollar a job" methodology. The system works. The pricing, less so.

YNAB started as a $60 one-time purchase. Then it moved to $50/year. Then $84. Now $109. That's an 82% price increase in six years, and the community frustration is loud. Monarch Money gets 37+ direct mentions as the top alternative in YNAB forums.

MyBudget (a module inside MyLife) uses the same envelope budgeting methodology. You create categories, assign money, and track spending against your plan. It also includes a subscription tracker with 215 pre-loaded services, something YNAB doesn't offer.

The price: $2. One time.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | YNAB | MyBudget (MyLife) |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Price** | $14.99/mo ($109/yr) | **$2 one-time** |
| **Envelope/zero-based budgeting** | Yes | Yes |
| **Subscription tracking** | No | **Yes (215 services)** |
| **Bank linking (Plaid)** | Yes | No (manual entry) |
| **Data storage** | YNAB's servers | **Your device only** |
| **Account required** | Yes | **No** |
| **Web app** | Yes | Yes (Next.js) |
| **Mobile app** | iOS, Android | iOS, Android |
| **Import from YNAB** | N/A | **Yes** |
| **Import from Mint** | Yes | **Yes** |
| **Net worth tracking** | Yes | Not yet |
| **Reports** | Advanced | Basic |
| **Goal tracking** | Yes | Not yet |
| **5-year cost** | $545 | **$2** |

### Key Differentiators

**Where MyBudget wins:**
- 98% cheaper ($2 vs $109/year)
- Built-in subscription tracking (YNAB has none)
- Complete data privacy (no server, no account)
- No Plaid dependency (no bank linking fees, no data middlemen)
- Includes access to 19 other MyLife modules for $18 more

**Where YNAB wins:**
- Automatic bank transaction import
- Sophisticated reporting (Age of Money, spending trends)
- 10+ years of refinement and polish
- Large community and educational resources
- Goal tracking and debt paydown tools

### The Trade-Off

YNAB's biggest advantage is automatic bank linking via Plaid. If you rely on transactions appearing automatically, YNAB delivers that. MyBudget requires manual entry.

But consider: Plaid charges YNAB $0.25-3.00 per bank connection per month. That's part of why YNAB keeps raising prices. MyBudget has zero API costs, which is why it can charge $2 forever.

Manual entry also means no one sits between you and your bank. No Plaid. No data aggregator. No third-party access to your accounts. Many YNAB users in r/ynab and Bogleheads forums cite this as a reason they'd prefer manual entry anyway.

### The Bottom Line

If bank linking and advanced reports are non-negotiable, YNAB is the better tool. If you want the envelope method without the $109/year price tag and without sharing your financial data with anyone, MyBudget is the obvious choice.

## Page 2: MyLife vs Goodreads

**Target keyword:** Goodreads alternative
**URL slug:** /compare/goodreads-alternative

### H1: MyLife vs Goodreads: Track Your Books Without Amazon

Goodreads has 150 million users. It hasn't shipped a meaningful update in years. Amazon bought it in 2013 and has let it stagnate while using your reading data to power recommendation algorithms across the Amazon ecosystem.

Your book ratings, your reviews, your TBR list, your reading patterns. All of it is product input for Amazon.

In 2020, Goodreads shut down its API, killing dozens of third-party reading tools. The message was clear: your reading data belongs to Amazon.

MyBooks (a module inside MyLife) is a book tracker that stores everything on your device. Amazon never sees your reading list. Nobody does.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Goodreads | MyBooks (MyLife) |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Price** | Free (you're the product) | **$2 one-time** |
| **Data storage** | Amazon's servers | **Your device only** |
| **Account required** | Yes (Amazon/email) | **No** |
| **TBR / Reading / Finished lists** | Yes | Yes |
| **Ratings** | 1-5 stars | **Half-star precision (0.5-5)** |
| **Reviews** | Public by default | **Private by default** |
| **Reading goals** | Yes | Yes |
| **Year in review** | Yes | Yes |
| **Barcode scanning** | No | **Yes** |
| **Goodreads CSV import** | N/A | **Yes** |
| **StoryGraph CSV import** | No | **Yes** |
| **Export data** | Limited | **CSV, JSON, Markdown** |
| **Social features** | Yes (reviews, friends, groups) | No |
| **Book metadata source** | Amazon | **Open Library (non-profit)** |
| **API for third-party tools** | Shut down (2020) | Open data format on device |
| **Privacy** | Amazon data pipeline | **Zero data collection** |

### Key Differentiators

**Where MyBooks wins:**
- Complete privacy (no Amazon data pipeline)
- No account required
- Half-star ratings (more precise than Goodreads' 1-5)
- Reviews private by default (no social pressure)
- Barcode scanning for quick adds
- Open data export (CSV, JSON, Markdown)
- Book data from Open Library, not Amazon

**Where Goodreads wins:**
- Social features (friends, groups, book clubs)
- 150 million user community
- User-generated reviews and ratings
- Author pages and events
- Reading challenges with social accountability
- Free (if you accept the data trade-off)

### Who Should Switch

MyBooks is for readers who want to track their reading life privately. If you use Goodreads as a social network (book clubs, friend reviews, reading challenges with accountability partners), Goodreads or StoryGraph are better fits.

If you use Goodreads as a personal database (your TBR list, your ratings, your reading log), MyBooks gives you the same functionality without the Amazon data pipeline.

StoryGraph Plus costs $50/year and requires a cloud account. MyBooks costs $2 and requires nothing.

### How to Switch

1. Go to Goodreads settings and export your library as CSV
2. Download MyLife and enable MyBooks
3. Import your Goodreads CSV into MyBooks
4. All your books, ratings, and reading dates transfer over

Your reading life, on your device, in under 5 minutes.

## Page 3: MyLife vs Surfline

**Target keyword:** Surfline alternative
**URL slug:** /compare/surfline-alternative

### H1: MyLife vs Surfline: Surf Forecasts for $2, Not $120/Year

Surfline charges $15.99/month ($119.99/year) for premium surf forecasts. In 2017, they acquired MagicSeaweed, eliminating the primary competitor and raising prices from $60/year to $120.

The data behind most surf forecasts comes from NOAA and NDBC buoys. Government data. Free to access.

Surfline's value is in packaging: 900+ cameras, spot-specific forecasts, editorial content, and mobile apps. Their cameras are genuinely valuable. The forecast data? That's public infrastructure.

MySurf (a module inside MyLife) uses the same NOAA and NDBC buoy data, adds AI-generated forecast narratives, and covers 200+ California spots. $2. One time.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Surfline Premium | MySurf (MyLife) |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Price** | $15.99/mo ($119.99/yr) | **$2 one-time** |
| **Swell data** | Yes | Yes (NOAA/NDBC) |
| **Wind data** | Yes | Yes |
| **Tide charts** | Yes | Yes |
| **Live cameras** | **900+** | No |
| **AI forecast narratives** | No | **Yes** |
| **Spot coverage** | 5,000+ global | 200+ California |
| **Data storage** | Surfline servers | **Your device** |
| **Account required** | Yes | **No** |
| **Ad-free** | Premium only | **Yes** |
| **5-year cost** | $599.95 | **$2** |

### Key Differentiators

**Where MySurf wins:**
- 60x cheaper ($2 vs $120/year)
- AI-generated narratives explain conditions in plain English
- No account required
- No data tracking (Surfline collects usage data)
- Zero ads

**Where Surfline wins:**
- 900+ live cameras (MySurf's biggest gap)
- Global coverage (5,000+ spots vs 200+ California)
- Human forecaster commentary
- Multi-day forecast models
- Surf photography and editorial content
- Decades of brand trust

### The Honest Trade-Off

If you check cameras before driving to the beach, Surfline has something MySurf can't replicate. A 900-camera network costs tens of millions of dollars to build and maintain.

But most surfers check the same 3-5 spots. They want swell height, period, direction, wind, and tide. That data comes from government buoys. MySurf gives you that data for $2 instead of $120/year.

For California surfers who primarily check data (not cameras), MySurf saves $118/year while providing the same underlying information plus AI narratives that explain what the numbers mean.

### The Bigger Picture

MySurf is one of 20+ modules in MyLife. A surfer who also budgets (YNAB, $109/yr), tracks workouts (Strava, $80/yr), and uses a meditation app (Calm, $70/yr) is spending $379/year on four apps.

MyLife replaces all four for $20. One time.

## Page 4: MyLife vs AllTrails

**Target keyword:** AllTrails alternative
**URL slug:** /compare/alltrails-alternative

### H1: MyLife vs AllTrails: Trail Tracking for $2, Not $36/Year

AllTrails has 60 million registered users and a $750M-$1B valuation. It won Apple's App of the Year in 2023. It's the dominant trail discovery and hiking platform.

It also requires an account, stores your hiking data (including GPS routes and location history) on their servers, and charges $35.99/year for full features like offline maps.

57.8 million Americans hiked in 2023, up 16% since 2019. Most of them don't need a $36/year subscription to walk in the woods.

MyTrails (a module inside MyLife) tracks your hikes with offline maps, GPS recording, and trail notes. $2. One time. Your routes stay on your device.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | AllTrails+ | MyTrails (MyLife) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Price** | $35.99/yr | **$2 one-time** |
| **Trail database** | **200,000+ trails** | Growing (public data sources) |
| **Offline maps** | Yes (premium) | Yes |
| **GPS recording** | Yes | Yes |
| **User reviews** | **Community-generated** | Personal notes |
| **Data storage** | AllTrails servers | **Your device** |
| **Account required** | Yes | **No** |
| **Location history** | Stored by AllTrails | **Your device only** |
| **Photo uploads** | Yes (their server) | Yes (your device) |
| **Social features** | Friends, lists, sharing | No |
| **5-year cost** | $179.95 | **$2** |

### Key Differentiators

**Where MyTrails wins:**
- 18x cheaper ($2 vs $36/year)
- Complete location privacy (GPS routes never uploaded)
- No account, no profile, no social pressure
- Part of a 20+ module suite (budgeting, fitness, health, etc.)

**Where AllTrails wins:**
- 200,000+ trail database with community reviews
- Trail discovery (finding new trails, not just tracking known ones)
- Community features (sharing, following, lists)
- Trail condition reports from recent hikers
- Curated collections and editorial content
- 60 million users contributing data

### Who Should Switch

AllTrails is a trail discovery platform. If you use it to find new hikes, read recent reviews, and check trail conditions, AllTrails' community data is hard to replace.

MyTrails is a trail tracking tool. If you hike the same trails regularly and want to log your hikes without uploading your GPS routes to a server, MyTrails is a simpler, cheaper, more private option.

## Page 5: MyLife vs Mint (for Displaced Users)

**Target keyword:** Mint replacement, Mint alternative 2026
**URL slug:** /compare/mint-alternative

### H1: Mint Is Gone. Here's Where Your Budget Should Live Now.

Mint shut down in March 2024. Intuit redirected 20 million users to Credit Karma, which lacks budgeting features. No categories. No savings goals. No spending analysis. No envelope system.

If you were a Mint user, you've been looking for a home for two years. Here's the landscape:

- **Monarch Money:** $90/year. Solid. Built by ex-Mint engineers. Raised $95.5M. Cloud-required.
- **YNAB:** $109/year. Great methodology. Keeps raising prices. Cloud-required.
- **Copilot:** $70/year. Design-forward. iOS-first. Cloud-required.
- **Rocket Money:** $72-144/year. Subscription tracking. Bill negotiation. Cloud-required.

Notice a pattern? Every Mint replacement requires cloud storage and charges $70-110/year.

MyBudget is different.

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Mint (RIP) | Monarch | YNAB | MyBudget (MyLife) |
|---------|-----------|---------|------|-------------------|
| **Price** | Free | $90/yr | $109/yr | **$2 one-time** |
| **Status** | Shut down | Active | Active | Active |
| **Bank linking** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No (by design)** |
| **Data storage** | Intuit cloud | Monarch cloud | YNAB cloud | **Your device** |
| **Account required** | Yes | Yes | Yes | **No** |
| **Envelope budgeting** | No | Partial | Yes | **Yes** |
| **Subscription tracking** | No | No | No | **Yes (215 services)** |
| **Import Mint data** | N/A | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |
| **Privacy** | Data → Credit Karma | Cloud-stored | Cloud-stored | **Zero data collection** |
| **5-year cost** | N/A (dead) | $450 | $545 | **$2** |

### What Happened to Your Mint Data

When Mint shut down, Intuit moved user data to Credit Karma. You didn't choose that. You didn't consent to it (beyond a buried clause in Intuit's ToS). Your financial data went where Intuit wanted it to go.

With MyBudget, this can't happen. Your data lives in a SQLite file on your device. We can't redirect it because we don't have it. We can't sell the company and watch your data go with it because there's no data on our end.

Mint proved that "free" apps funded by data monetization can disappear overnight. MyBudget proves that $2 one-time is a more sustainable model for everyone involved.

### How to Switch

1. If you exported your Mint data before shutdown, import the CSV into MyBudget
2. If not, start fresh with your current budget categories
3. Set up envelopes for your spending categories
4. Enable the subscription tracker to find recurring charges

The whole process takes 15 minutes.
