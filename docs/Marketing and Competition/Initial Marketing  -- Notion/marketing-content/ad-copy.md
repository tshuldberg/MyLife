### Variant 2 - The Privacy Story

**Headline:** Your Apps Know More About You Than Your Doctor
**Primary Text:**
Your budget app knows your income and every purchase. Your fitness app knows your weight and location. Your fasting app knows your eating schedule. Your mood tracker knows your emotional patterns. Your period tracker knows your cycle.

All of it sits on servers you don't control, governed by privacy policies that change without notice.

MyFitnessPal was breached: 150 million accounts exposed.
Mint shut down: 20 million users redirected.
Flo Health: 380 million users' cycle data on their servers.

MyLife stores everything locally on your device. No server. No account. No cloud. We never have your data, so we can never lose it.

20+ modules. $20 one-time. Built for people who think their personal data should stay personal.

## Reddit Ads (3 Variants)

### Variant 1 - r/personalfinance, r/ynab, r/budgeting

**Headline:** YNAB: $109/yr. MyBudget: $2. One Time. Same Envelope Method.

**Body:**
Built a privacy-first envelope budgeting app after YNAB's latest price hike.

MyBudget does envelope budgeting + subscription tracking (215 services pre-loaded). $2 one-time. No bank linking. No cloud. All data on your device.

The trade-off: manual entry only. No Plaid integration. For some people that's a dealbreaker. For others, it's the feature.

Part of MyLife (20+ app modules for $20 total), but MyBudget works on its own.

**Targeting:** r/personalfinance, r/ynab, r/budgeting, r/frugal, r/povertyfinance

---

### Variant 2 - r/privacy, r/degoogle, r/privacytools

**Headline:** 20+ personal apps with zero cloud dependency. All data stored locally. $20 one-time.

**Body:**
Built MyLife because every personal app stores your data on someone else's server.

Budget tracking, fasting timer, book tracker, workout logger, meditation timer, cycle tracker, mood diary, medication reminders, and more. Everything runs in a local SQLite database on your device.

No accounts. No telemetry. No analytics SDK. No server. No way for us to access your data even if we wanted to.

Free fasting timer to try it. Individual modules $2. Complete suite $20 (one-time, not monthly).

Looking for feedback from this community on what we could do better for privacy-conscious users.

**Targeting:** r/privacy, r/degoogle, r/privacytools, r/selfhosted, r/fossdroid

---

### Variant 3 - r/fitness, r/bodybuilding, r/running

**Headline:** Workout tracker that doesn't want to be a social network. $2. No account.

**Body:**
Every workout app wants you to follow people, share PRs, and build a profile. Strava is $80/yr. Fitbod is $156/yr. Both require accounts and cloud storage.

I wanted a workout logger that tracks exercises, sets, reps, and weight without uploading my body measurements to a server.

MyWorkouts: $2 one-time. All data on your device. No social feed. No GPS tracking. No body data in the cloud.

Part of MyLife (20+ modules including a free fasting timer), but works on its own.

**Targeting:** r/fitness, r/bodybuilding, r/running, r/weightroom, r/homegym, r/xxfitness
