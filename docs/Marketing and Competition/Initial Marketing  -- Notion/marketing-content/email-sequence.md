## Email 1: Welcome + Getting Started (Immediate)

**Subject:** Welcome to MyLife. Here's how to get the most out of it.
**Subject (A/B variant):** You just saved yourself $800/year. Here's what's next.

**Preview text:** Your fasting tracker is already running. Here are the other 19 modules waiting for you.

**Body:**

Hey,

You downloaded MyLife. Good move.

MyFast is already yours, free, forever. No trial, no credit card, no catch. Open it, tap Start Fast, and you're tracking.

But here's the thing most people don't know: MyFast is one of 20+ modules inside MyLife. Each one replaces a standalone app that charges $5-15/month.

Budget tracking? MyBudget. $2, not $109/year like YNAB.
Book tracking? MyBooks. $2, not $50/year like StoryGraph Plus.
Workout logging? MyWorkouts. $2, not $80/year like Strava.
Meditation? MyMeditate. $2, not $70/year like Calm.

All stored on your device. No accounts. No cloud. No one sees your data.

**Quick start:**
1. Open MyLife and tap the Discover tab
2. Browse modules by category
3. Enable any module to try it
4. Buy what you like ($2/module or $20 for everything)

Welcome aboard.

## Email 2: The App Subscription Tax (Day 2)

**Subject:** You're paying $820/year and probably don't realize it
**Subject (A/B variant):** Add up your app subscriptions. The number will surprise you.

**Preview text:** YNAB, Surfline, Strava, Calm, MFP. They add up faster than you think.

**Body:**

Quick question: how many apps do you pay for monthly?

Most people guess 3-4. The real answer is usually 8-12.

Here's what that costs:

YNAB: $109/year
Surfline: $120/year
Strava: $80/year
Zero Plus (fasting): $70/year
Calm: $70/year
MyFitnessPal: $200/year
StoryGraph Plus: $50/year
Daylio: $36/year
Habitify: $30/year
Notion: $96/year

Total: $861/year. $4,305 over five years.

We call it the App Subscription Tax. It's what happens when every app you use shifts to monthly billing and you never add it all up.

The worst part? Each of those apps stores your personal data, your budget, your body measurements, your reading habits, your mood, your medication schedule, on their servers. You're paying them to hold your data hostage.

MyLife replaces all 10 of those apps. $20. One time. Everything stays on your device.

That's not marketing spin. It's arithmetic.

P.S. Already using MyFast? You're saving $70/year on fasting tracker fees. That's just the start.

## Email 3: Module Spotlight - MyFast (Day 4)

**Subject:** You've been fasting for 4 days. Here's what that data means.
**Subject (A/B variant):** Your fasting streaks are building. Here's what to do next.

**Preview text:** MyFast isn't just a timer. It's the start of something bigger.

**Body:**

You've been using MyFast for a few days now. You might have noticed something: it just works.

No upsell to a "premium" tier. No paywall after your "free trial" ends. No push notifications begging you to upgrade. Just a fasting timer that tracks your fasts, builds streaks, and stores everything on your device.

Zero charges $70/year for essentially the same thing. Simple charges $30-60/year. BodyFast pushes you to their "Coach" plan.

MyFast is free. Always. It's the entry point to MyLife because we think you should try before you buy, and you should try without pressure.

Here's what makes it better inside the MyLife suite:

When you pair MyFast with other modules, things get interesting. Your fasting data can correlate with mood tracking (MyMood), sleep patterns (MySleep), workout performance (MyWorkouts), and calorie intake (MyCalories). No standalone fasting app can do that.

Your health data, all in one place, all on your device, all talking to each other.

## Email 4: The Privacy Story (Day 7)

**Subject:** Where your data actually goes when you use a "free" app
**Subject (A/B variant):** MyFitnessPal was breached. 150 million accounts. Here's the alternative.

**Preview text:** Your budget, your health, your reading habits. They're all on someone else's server right now.

**Body:**

Let's talk about where your data is right now.

If you use YNAB, your complete financial picture, every dollar, every budget category, every account balance, sits on their servers. If they get breached, your finances are exposed. If they get acquired, your data goes to the buyer.

If you use MyFitnessPal, this already happened. In 2018, 150 million accounts were compromised. Names, emails, and hashed passwords. The company that was supposed to track your meals was tracking your data right into a breach.

Flo Health has 380 million downloads. All that intimate cycle tracking data lives on their servers. After the Dobbs decision in 2022, researchers found that 61% of popular period tracking apps had code vulnerabilities. Many shared data without meaningful consent.

Medisafe, the most popular medication tracker, makes its money from pharmaceutical companies. Your prescription list isn't a private health record. It's a marketing asset.

Mint shut down in 2024 and redirected 20 million users to Credit Karma. Users didn't choose that. Intuit did.

Here's how MyLife is different:

There is no server. There is no account. There is no cloud. Your data exists in a single SQLite file on your device. We literally cannot see it. We cannot sell it. We cannot lose it in a breach. We cannot hand it to a government. We cannot change our privacy policy to allow new uses of your data, because we never have your data.

That's not a feature. That's the architecture.

## Email 5: Module Spotlight - MyBudget for Mint Refugees (Day 10)

**Subject:** If you used Mint, you know what happens when a free app shuts down
**Subject (A/B variant):** YNAB costs $109/year. MyBudget costs $2. Here's the trade-off.

**Preview text:** Envelope budgeting + subscription tracking. No bank linking. No monthly fee.

**Body:**

Mint had 20 million users when it shut down. Intuit redirected everyone to Credit Karma, which doesn't have budgeting features. Overnight, millions of people lost their budget tracking tool.

If you were one of them, you probably looked at the alternatives:

YNAB: $109/year. Great methodology, but the price keeps rising ($50 to $84 to $109 in six years).
Monarch Money: $90/year. Solid app, $850M valuation, but your financial data lives on their servers.
Copilot: $70/year. Design-forward, but iOS-first and cloud-required.

All of them require bank account linking. All of them store your financial data in the cloud. All of them charge monthly.

MyBudget takes a different approach:

$2. One time. No bank linking.

You enter transactions manually. That sounds like a step backward until you realize what you gain: no Plaid fees (which cost competitors $0.25-3.00 per connection per month), no data aggregator sitting between you and your bank, and no one, not us, not Plaid, not a hacker, can see your financial data.

Plus, MyBudget includes a subscription tracker with 215 pre-loaded services. See exactly what you're paying for. Spot the subscriptions you forgot about. The average American has 12 paid subscriptions and 42% have forgotten about at least one.

Import your data from YNAB or Mint backups. Start fresh or bring your history with you.

-- The MyLife Team

P.S. Even if you only buy MyBudget ($2), you save $107 in year one versus YNAB. Over five years, that's $543.

## Email 6: Social Proof + User Stories (Day 14)

**Subject:** What happens when you replace 10 subscriptions with one purchase
**Subject (A/B variant):** "I did the math. I was spending $67/month on apps."

**Preview text:** Real numbers from real people who switched to MyLife.

**Body:**

We asked early MyLife users to add up what they were spending before.

Here's what they found:

"I had YNAB, Zero Plus, Calm, and StoryGraph Plus. Four apps, four subscriptions, four accounts, four passwords. $265/year. I replaced all four with MyLife for $20. My only regret is not doing it sooner." - Budget + wellness user

"I'm a surfer and a lifter. Surfline plus Strava was $200/year. MySurf and MyWorkouts cost me $4 total. Forever. And neither one uploads my GPS data to a server." - Fitness + outdoor user

"I tracked my cycle on Flo for three years. After Dobbs, I couldn't stop thinking about where that data was. MyCycle stores everything on my phone. That peace of mind is worth more than $2." - Health-conscious user

"I was a YNAB zealot for six years. Paid $50/year, then $84, then $109. The methodology is sound, but I don't need to pay $109/year for envelope categories. MyBudget does the same thing for $2." - Budgeting power user

The pattern is always the same: people add up their subscriptions, realize the number is bigger than they thought, switch to MyLife, and wonder why they waited.

## Email 7: Complete Suite Offer (Day 21)

**Subject:** 20 apps. $20. Last time we'll bring it up.
**Subject (A/B variant):** Here's everything MyLife includes for $20. Then we'll stop emailing.

**Preview text:** The full module list, the full savings math, and the full pitch. One time.

**Body:**

This is the last email in this sequence. We don't do "30% off if you act now" urgency tactics. The price is $20 today, $20 tomorrow, $20 next year. It doesn't change.

Here's everything you get with MyLife Complete:

**Health & Wellness (6 modules)**
MyFast (free), MyMeditate, MySleep, MyCalories, MyMood, MyCycle, MyMeds

**Finance (1 module)**
MyBudget (envelope budgeting + 215-service subscription tracker)

**Fitness & Outdoors (3 modules)**
MyWorkouts, MySurf, MyTrails

**Reading & Learning (3 modules)**
MyBooks, MyWords, MyFlash

**Productivity (4 modules)**
MyRecipes, MyNotes, MyJournal, MyVoice

**Lifestyle (3 modules)**
MyCar, MyHomes, MyStars, MyPets

Total: 20+ modules. All on your device. No accounts. No cloud. No subscriptions.

**The math one more time:**
- 10 standalone app subscriptions: $861/year
- MyLife Complete: $20 (once)
- Year 1 savings: $841
- 5-year savings: $4,285

Every new module we build gets added to Complete at no extra cost. You buy once. You own it.

If $20 feels like too much commitment, start with one module for $2. Or keep using MyFast for free. There's no pressure. The price will be the same whenever you're ready.

Thanks for reading. We'll keep building modules. You keep living your life.

2. Email 5 angle (Mint refugee vs. YNAB price frustration)
3. Email 7 CTA (complete suite vs. individual module entry)
4. Overall sequence length (test 5-email vs. 7-email variant)

### Segmentation Triggers

After email 3, segment based on engagement:
- **High engagement** (opened 3/3, clicked 2+): accelerate to email 5 (skip email 4)
- **Low engagement** (opened 1/3, zero clicks): send re-engagement variant of email 4 with stronger subject line
- **Already purchased**: exit sequence, move to post-purchase retention sequence
