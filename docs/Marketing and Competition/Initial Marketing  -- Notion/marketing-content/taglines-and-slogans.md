## "App Subscription Tax" Messaging Variants

### The Core Narrative

**The App Subscription Tax** is what happens when every app you use charges $5-15/month. Budget app: $14.99/month. Surf forecast: $15.99/month. Workout tracker: $12.99/month. Meditation: $5.83/month. Calorie counter: $16.67/month. Add them up. The average power user pays $820/year or more to rent the apps they use every day.

You don't rent your calculator. You don't subscribe to your alarm clock. Why are you renting your budget tracker?

MyLife ends the App Subscription Tax. 20+ apps. $20 one-time. Your data stays on your device. That's it.

### Short-form Variants

**For Twitter/X:**
The average American pays $820/year across 10 app subscriptions. That's the App Subscription Tax. MyLife replaces all of them for $20. Once. Forever.

**For ads:**
Stop paying the App Subscription Tax. 20 apps. $20. One time.

**For email subject lines:**
- You're paying $820/year in app subscriptions. Here's how to pay $20.
- The App Subscription Tax: what it costs you and how to stop paying it
- I canceled 10 app subscriptions and replaced them with one $20 purchase

**For landing page hero:**
You're paying the App Subscription Tax.
YNAB wants $109/year. Surfline wants $120. Strava wants $80. Calm wants $70.
Add it up. You're spending $800+ a year to rent apps that track your life.

MyLife replaces all of them. $20. One time. Your data never leaves your device.

**For press pitches:**
MyLife is a privacy-first app hub that replaces 20+ standalone app subscriptions with a single $20 one-time purchase. While competitors like YNAB ($109/yr), Surfline ($120/yr), and Calm ($70/yr) charge recurring fees and store user data on their servers, MyLife keeps everything on-device with zero accounts, zero telemetry, and zero cloud dependency.

## Competitive Positioning Lines

| Against | Line |
|---------|------|
| **YNAB** | YNAB charges $109/year and calls it budgeting. We charge $2 and call it done. |
| **Surfline** | Surfline wants $120/year to tell you the waves are flat. We charge $2. |
| **Calm** | Calm charges $70/year for a meditation timer. We give you one for $2. Or free, inside the suite. |
| **Goodreads** | Goodreads is free because you're the product. MyBooks is $2 because your reading list isn't for sale. |
| **Strava** | Strava tracks your runs and your data. We only track your runs. |
| **MyFitnessPal** | MFP was hacked. 150 million accounts. With MyLife, there's no account to hack. |

## Voice Guidelines

**Do:** Sound like a friend who found a better deal and is genuinely excited to share it. Direct, specific, slightly irreverent. Use real numbers. Name competitors. State facts.

**Don't:** Sound corporate. Don't use words like "innovative," "cutting-edge," "best-in-class," "robust," or "seamless." Don't hedge with "almost," "nearly," or "up to." Don't use exclamation points. Let the numbers speak.

**Sentence rhythm:** Mix short and long. Lead with short. Follow with detail.

*Example:*
$820 a year. That's what 10 app subscriptions cost the average power user. Budget tracker, workout logger, fasting timer, meditation app, book tracker, surf forecast, habit tracker, calorie counter, sleep tracker, note-taking app. Each one charges $5-15/month. Each one stores your data on their servers. Each one sends you "your trial is ending" emails.

MyLife replaces all of them. $20. Once. On your device. No accounts. No cloud. No renewals.

That's not a promotion. That's the price. Forever.
