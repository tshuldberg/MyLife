WHY MYLIFE EXISTS

Every personal app you use stores your data on someone else's server. Your budget, your body measurements, your medication schedule, your mood, your menstrual cycle, your location data from hikes and surf sessions. All of it sits in databases you don't control, governed by privacy policies that change without notice.

MyLife stores everything in a single SQLite database on your device. We can't see your data because we never have it. There's no account to hack because there's no account. There's no server to breach because there's no server.

THE MATH

10 average app subscriptions: $820/year
MyLife Complete: $20 (one-time)
Year 1 savings: $800
5-year savings: $4,080

That's a 97.6% reduction in year one and 99.5% over five years.

BUILT FOR PRIVACY

- Zero analytics, zero telemetry
- No accounts or sign-ups required
- All data stored locally on your device
- Export your data anytime in open formats
- No Plaid, no bank linking, no third-party data sharing

## Standalone Module Listings

Each standalone module listed separately on the App Store should reference the MyLife hub for discoverability.

### MyFast - Intermittent Fasting Tracker

**Title:** MyFast - Fasting Timer
**Subtitle:** Free. Private. No account needed.

**Description:**
A fasting tracker that respects your privacy. No account required. No data uploaded. No upsell to a $70/year subscription.

Start a fast with one tap. Track your fasting history. Build streaks. See your patterns over time. All data stays on your device in a local database you own.

MyFast supports popular fasting protocols: 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, OMAD, and custom windows. Set your own schedule or let the timer run.

ALWAYS FREE
MyFast is the free module inside MyLife. No trial period. No feature gates. No credit card. Just a fasting timer that works.

PART OF MYLIFE
MyFast is one of 20+ modules in the MyLife hub. Like what you see? Add MyBudget, MyBooks, MyWorkouts, and more for $2 each or get everything for $20 (one-time).

Zero, Simple, and Fastic charge $30-70/year for fasting trackers. MyFast is free. And private.

**Keywords:** fasting timer free, intermittent fasting tracker, 16 8 fasting app, fasting no account, private fasting app, IF tracker free, zero alternative free

### MyBudget - Envelope Budgeting

**Title:** MyBudget - Envelope Budget
**Subtitle:** $2. Not $109/year like YNAB.

**Description:**
Envelope budgeting and subscription tracking in one app. No bank linking. No cloud. No monthly fees.

MyBudget uses the proven envelope method: give every dollar a job, track spending against categories, and see exactly where your money goes. Plus a built-in subscription tracker with 215 pre-loaded services to help you spot what you're paying for and what you can cut.

YNAB charges $109/year. Monarch charges $90/year. Copilot charges $70/year. MyBudget costs $2. Once.

The trade-off: MyBudget doesn't link to your bank (that's a feature, not a bug). You enter transactions manually, which means no Plaid fees, no data aggregator middlemen, and no one sitting between you and your financial data.

PRIVACY BY DESIGN
Your budget data never leaves your device. No account. No sync. No server. Your spending patterns, income, and subscription costs are stored in a local SQLite database that you fully control.

Mint shut down and redirected users to Credit Karma. YNAB raised prices three times. MyBudget can't raise its price because you already own it.

PART OF MYLIFE
MyBudget is one of 20+ modules in the MyLife app hub. Get it individually for $2, in a 5-app bundle for $5, or get everything for $20 (one-time).

**Keywords:** envelope budgeting app, YNAB alternative, budget tracker no subscription, private budgeting app, one time purchase budget, Mint replacement, subscription tracker, manual budget app, offline budget app, zero based budgeting

### MyBooks - Book Tracker

**Title:** MyBooks - Book Tracker
**Subtitle:** Your library. Not Amazon's.

**Description:**
Track your reading life without giving it to Amazon. No account. No cloud. No social pressure. Just you and your books.

Build your library. Manage TBR, reading, and finished lists. Rate books with half-star precision. Write private reviews. Set reading goals. See your stats and year-in-review. Import your Goodreads or StoryGraph data with one CSV upload.

Goodreads has 150 million users and hasn't shipped a meaningful update in years. It shut down its API. It tracks your reading data for Amazon's recommendation engine. Your reading list is literally a product.

MyBooks is different. Your library lives on your device. We don't know what you read, how you rate it, or what's on your TBR. We can't, because we never have the data.

Book metadata comes from Open Library (a non-profit). Barcode scanning for quick adds. Export your data anytime as CSV, JSON, or Markdown.

$2 one-time. StoryGraph Plus charges $50/year.

PART OF MYLIFE
MyBooks is one of 20+ modules in the MyLife app hub. Get it for $2, or get the complete suite for $20 (one-time).

**Keywords:** book tracker private, Goodreads alternative, reading tracker no account, book list app, reading log offline, book rating app, library tracker, StoryGraph alternative, TBR tracker, reading stats

### MyWorkouts - Workout Logger

**Title:** MyWorkouts - Workout Log
**Subtitle:** Log every rep. Share nothing.

**Description:**
A workout logger that tracks your lifts, not your location. No social feed. No activity sharing. No leaderboards where strangers see your stats. Just a clean log of what you did in the gym.

Track exercises, sets, reps, and weight. View progress over time. Build custom routines. Log any type of workout: strength, cardio, flexibility, or custom.

Strava charges $80/year. Fitbod charges $156/year. Hevy is free but requires an account and cloud storage. MyWorkouts costs $2, keeps everything on your device, and never asks you to create a profile.

PART OF MYLIFE
MyWorkouts is one of 20+ modules in the MyLife app hub. Get it for $2, or get the complete suite for $20 (one-time).

### MySurf - Surf Forecast

**Title:** MySurf - Surf Forecast
**Subtitle:** Forecasts without the $120/year fee.

Surf conditions, swell data, and AI-generated forecasting narratives for California spots. Built on NOAA and NDBC buoy data. No camera network fees. No $120/year paywall.

Check spot conditions with swell height, period, direction, wind, and tide data. Get AI-written forecast narratives that explain what the data means in plain English. Browse 200+ curated California surf spots.

Surfline charges $15.99/month ($120/year) for premium forecasts. They acquired MagicSeaweed to eliminate competition. MySurf uses the same underlying government data (NOAA, NDBC buoys) and costs $2. One time.

The trade-off: no live cameras. If you need to watch a cam before you drive to the beach, Surfline still has that. But if you want swell data, wind reports, and tide charts without paying $120/year, MySurf has you covered.

### MyCycle - Cycle Tracker
