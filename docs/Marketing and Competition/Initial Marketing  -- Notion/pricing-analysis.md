# MyLife Pricing Model & TAM Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Pricing Tiers:** $2 individual app | $5 five-app bundle | $20 complete suite (all one-time)
**Data Sources:** 7 market research reports covering 50+ competitors across 20+ categories

---

## Executive Summary

MyLife targets a combined addressable market exceeding **$150B** across 20+ app categories spanning health, finance, fitness, productivity, home, and lifestyle. Users currently pay **$100-$300+ per year** for standalone subscriptions across these categories. MyLife replaces all of them with a **$20 one-time purchase**, representing a **90-98% lifetime savings** versus the subscription status quo.

At conservative capture rates, MyLife can generate meaningful revenue purely through one-time purchases:

| Scenario | Users | Weighted Revenue (mix of tiers) |
|----------|-------|--------------------------------|
| Modest (0.1% capture) | 150,000 | $1.5-2.5M |
| Growth (0.5% capture) | 750,000 | $7.5-12.5M |
| Breakout (1% capture) | 1,500,000 | $15-25M |

The one-time pricing model is a deliberate strategic choice: it weaponizes subscription fatigue, eliminates churn, turns users into evangelists, and creates a viral pricing story ("I replaced $200/year in apps with a single $20 purchase").

## 2. The App Subscription Tax

### What a "Power User" Pays Today

A typical privacy-conscious user who cares about health, productivity, and personal organization is currently paying across multiple standalone apps:

| Category | App | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Budgeting | YNAB | $14.99/mo | $109.00/yr |
| Surf Forecasting | Surfline Premium | $9.99/mo | $119.99/yr |
| Workout Tracking | Strava Summit | $6.67/mo | $79.99/yr |
| Fasting | Zero Plus | $5.83/mo | $69.99/yr |
| Mood Tracking | Daylio Premium | $3.00/mo | $35.99/yr |
| Habit Tracking | Habitify Premium | $4.99/mo | $29.99/yr |
| Book Tracking | StoryGraph Plus | $4.17/mo | $49.99/yr |
| Meditation | Calm | $5.83/mo | $69.99/yr |
| Calorie Tracking | MyFitnessPal Premium | $13.33/mo | $159.99/yr |
| Note-Taking | Notion Personal | $8.00/mo | $96.00/yr |
| **Total** | **10 apps** | **$76.80/mo** | **$820.92/yr** |

### With MyLife Instead

| Tier | Price | Modules | Cost Per App |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Individual App | **$2** (one-time) | 1 module | $2.00 |
| 5-App Bundle | **$5** (one-time) | 5 modules | $1.00 each |
| MyLife Complete | **$20** (one-time) | All 20+ modules | ~$0.80-1.00 each |

### The Savings Math

| Metric | Standalone Apps | MyLife Complete |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Year 1 cost | $820.92 | $20.00 |
| Year 2 cumulative | $1,641.84 | $20.00 |
| Year 3 cumulative | $2,462.76 | $20.00 |
| Year 5 cumulative | $4,104.60 | $20.00 |
| **Lifetime savings (5 years)** | -- | **$4,084.60 (99.5%)** |

Even a lighter user with just 5 subscriptions (budgeting + fasting + habits + books + meditation) paying ~$350/yr saves **$345/yr in Year 1 alone** and $1,730 over 5 years.

### The Headline Number

> **Users currently spend $820+/year on 10 app subscriptions. MyLife replaces all of them for a one-time $20 purchase. That is a 97.6% savings in Year 1 and 99.5% savings over 5 years.**

## 4. Pricing Tier Validation

### Cost Per App at Each Tier

| Tier | Price | Modules Accessible | Cost Per App | vs. Competitor Monthly |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Individual | $2 | 1 | **$2.00** | vs. $5-15/mo (96-99% less) |
| 5-App Bundle | $5 | 5 | **$1.00** | vs. $25-75/mo (97-99% less) |
| Complete | $20 | 20+ | **$0.80-1.00** | vs. $100-300/mo (99%+ less) |

### How MyLife Pricing Compares to Competitors

| Competitor | Their Annual Cost | MyLife Equivalent (One-Time) | Savings Factor |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| YNAB | $109/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 55-109x cheaper |
| Surfline Premium | $119.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 60-120x cheaper |
| Strava Summit | $79.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 40-80x cheaper |
| Zero Plus | $69.99/yr | **Free** (MyFast is free tier) | Infinite |
| Calm | $69.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 35-70x cheaper |
| MyFitnessPal Premium | $159.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 80-160x cheaper |
| StoryGraph Plus | $49.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 25-50x cheaper |
| Quizlet Plus | $95.88/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 48-96x cheaper |
| Notion Personal | $96/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 48-96x cheaper |
| AllTrails+ | $35.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 18-36x cheaper |
| Flo Premium | $49.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 25-50x cheaper |
| Day One Premium | $49.99/yr | $2 (individual) or $1 (in bundle) | 25-50x cheaper |

### Price Elasticity Analysis

| Price Point | Individual | 5-Pack | Complete | Pros | Cons |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|------|------|
| **$1 / $3 / $15** | Impulse buy | Great value | Very cheap | Maximum conversion | May signal low quality |
| **$2 / $5 / $20** (current) | Still impulse | Strong value | Compelling | Sweet spot: cheap enough to try, enough to signal quality | Revenue per user is low |
| **$3 / $7 / $25** | Reasonable | Good value | Competitive | Higher revenue per user | Slightly more friction |
| **$5 / $10 / $30** | Considered purchase | Fair value | Still cheap vs. subs | Better unit economics | Loses "impulse buy" advantage |

**Recommendation: $2 / $5 / $20 is the optimal pricing.**

Rationale:
- **$2 individual** is an impulse buy. No deliberation needed. Users spend more on coffee. This is the "try it" price point.
- **$5 five-pack** creates a clear "deal" vs. 5 x $2 = $10. The 50% discount makes the bundle feel like a steal.
- **$20 complete** is the "just buy everything" price. When users compare $20 one-time to $109/yr for YNAB alone, the value proposition is so extreme it becomes shareable. Users will screenshot this comparison and post it.

The pricing works because it is so aggressively low that it becomes a marketing asset. The price itself is the marketing message.

## 5. Bundle Economics

### Why Bundling Works

The prediction markets report demonstrated that consolidation wins through three mechanisms, all applicable to MyLife:

**1. Cross-Sell Economics (DraftKings Model)**

DraftKings' LTV:CAC ratio is 6.75:1 because each additional product (sportsbook, casino, DFS) increases lifetime value without proportionally increasing customer acquisition cost. MyLife applies the same dynamic:

| User Journey | CAC Impact | LTV Impact |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| User discovers MyFast (free) | $0 CAC (organic/free tier) | $0 (free module) |
| Likes it, buys MyBudget for $2 | $0 incremental CAC | +$2 LTV |
| Buys 5-pack (adds MyBooks, MyHabits, MyWorkouts) | $0 incremental CAC | +$5 LTV (total $5) |
| Goes all-in, upgrades to Complete for $20 | $0 incremental CAC | +$15 upgrade LTV (total $20) |

**Effective LTV:CAC ratio: Potentially infinite** (if initial acquisition is through the free MyFast module).

**2. Reduced Acquisition Cost**

Individual app marketing is expensive. Each standalone app needs its own ASO, its own ad campaigns, its own social presence. With MyLife:
- One app listing, one brand, one marketing budget
- Free module (MyFast) drives organic acquisition
- Each module is a potential discovery vector ("I searched for fasting apps and found MyLife, which also has budgeting")
- Word-of-mouth is amplified ("You won't believe this app does EVERYTHING for $20")

**3. Retention Through Breadth**

Standalone apps have ~10-15% 30-day retention. But a user who uses MyFast AND MyBudget AND MyBooks daily has three reasons to keep the app installed instead of one. Each additional active module multiplies switching costs.

| Active Modules | Estimated 30-Day Retention | Estimated 1-Year Retention |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 module | 15% (industry average) | 5% |
| 2-3 modules | 35% (estimated) | 15% |
| 4-6 modules | 55% (estimated) | 30% |
| 7+ modules | 75%+ (estimated) | 50%+ |

### Customer Acquisition Cost Advantages

| Channel | Estimated CAC | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Organic (free MyFast)** | $0 | Free module drives zero-cost acquisition |
| **App Store search** | $1-3 per install | One listing serves 20+ search terms |
| **Word of mouth** | $0 | Extreme pricing drives viral sharing |
| **Reddit/forums** | $0 | Privacy-first positioning resonates in r/privacy, r/budgeting, r/fitness communities |
| **Content marketing** | $0.50-2 per install | Blog posts comparing "$820/yr in apps vs $20 one-time" |
| **Paid social** | $3-8 per install | Higher CAC but high conversion at $2 price point |

**Blended CAC target: $1-3 per installing user.**

At $20 complete, even a $3 CAC delivers 6.7x return on acquisition spend. At $5 five-pack, a $1 CAC delivers 5x return. At $2 individual, the margin is tighter but the volume opportunity is massive.

### LTV Projections

Since MyLife uses one-time pricing, LTV equals the purchase price (no churn, no renewal):

| Tier | LTV | At $2 CAC | LTV:CAC |
|------|-----|----------|---------|
| Individual ($2) | $2 | Break-even | 1:1 |
| 5-Pack ($5) | $5 | $3 profit | 2.5:1 |
| Complete ($20) | $20 | $18 profit | 10:1 |
| Upgrade path ($2 -> $5 -> $20) | $20 cumulative | $18 profit | 10:1 |

**Key insight:** The individual $2 tier is not a profit center. It is a conversion funnel entry point. Users who buy a single module at $2 experience the quality, then upgrade to the 5-pack or complete suite. The real revenue comes from the $5 and $20 tiers.

### Conversion Funnel Assumptions

| Stage | Conversion Rate | Users (from 100K installs) |
|-------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Install (free via MyFast) | 100% | 100,000 |
| Activate 1+ module | 60% | 60,000 |
| Purchase individual ($2) | 8% of installs | 8,000 |
| Purchase 5-pack ($5) | 5% of installs | 5,000 |
| Purchase complete ($20) | 3% of installs | 3,000 |
| **Total revenue per 100K installs** | | **$16K + $25K + $60K = $101K** |

**Revenue per install: ~$1.01** (blended across all users, including free)

At 1M installs: ~$1M revenue
At 10M installs: ~$10M revenue
At 50M installs: ~$50M revenue

## 6. One-Time vs Subscription Analysis

### The Core Trade-Off

| Metric | One-Time ($20) | Subscription ($4.99/mo) |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Revenue per user, Year 1 | $20 | $59.88 |
| Revenue per user, Year 2 | $0 | $59.88 (if retained) |
| Revenue per user, Year 3 | $0 | $59.88 (if retained) |
| Lifetime revenue (3-yr, 40% annual churn) | $20 | $95.81 |
| Lifetime revenue (5-yr, 40% annual churn) | $20 | $108.68 |
| **Conversion rate** | **Much higher** | **Much lower** |
| **User sentiment** | Positive (ownership) | Negative (another subscription) |
| **Viral factor** | Very high ("$20 for everything!") | Low (just another app) |

### Break-Even Analysis

At what user volume does one-time match subscription in total revenue?

**Subscription model:**
- Assume 2% conversion rate (industry average for freemium apps)
- 40% annual churn
- 100K installs -> 2,000 subscribers -> $119,760 Year 1, $71,856 Year 2, $43,114 Year 3
- 3-year total: $234,730

**One-time model:**
- Assume 16% purchase rate (8% individual + 5% 5-pack + 3% complete, per funnel above)
- 100K installs -> $101K revenue (one-time)
- BUT: higher conversion means more users, more word-of-mouth, faster growth
- If the one-time model grows 3x faster due to lower friction: 300K installs -> $303K revenue

**The math tilts toward one-time when viral growth compensates for lower per-user revenue.**

### Why One-Time Is the Right Choice for MyLife

**1. Subscription fatigue is real and growing.**
- 6% growth in one-time purchase preference in 2025
- Average US consumer has 12 paid subscriptions spending $219/month
- 42% of consumers have forgotten about subscriptions they still pay for
- MyLife's entire value proposition is "stop paying $100+/mo for apps." Charging a subscription undermines this message.

**2. One-time pricing is the marketing message.**
- "$20 for 20+ apps, forever" is a shareable, memorable, viral-ready pitch
- "$4.99/mo for 20+ apps" is just another subscription, blending in with the noise
- The one-time price IS the differentiator. It is what people screenshot and share.

**3. Privacy-first + one-time = maximum trust.**
- Subscriptions create incentive for the developer to collect data and track engagement metrics to optimize retention
- One-time purchases align developer and user incentives: build a great product, charge once, done
- This consistency reinforces the privacy-first brand promise

**4. Proven models exist.**
- Streaks (habit tracker): $4.99 one-time, won Apple Design Award, sustainable business
- Anki iOS: $25 one-time, generates ~$10.8M/year from a single platform
- Paprika (recipes): $4.99 one-time, raised $5M Series A, cult following
- These prove that one-time purchase apps can build sustainable, fundable businesses

**5. Future revenue from new modules.**
- Each new module added to MyLife can trigger upgrade purchases from existing users
- User bought individual MyBudget for $2? When MyCalories launches, they might upgrade to the 5-pack ($5) or complete ($20)
- Module expansion creates a natural "drip" of revenue events without subscriptions

### Should MyLife Consider Subscription? (Pros/Cons)

| Factor | One-Time (Current) | Subscription (Alternative) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Recurring revenue | No | Yes |
| Investor appeal | Lower (no MRR) | Higher (predictable MRR) |
| User trust | Very high | Lower (another subscription) |
| Marketing message | Exceptional ("$20 forever") | Average ("$4.99/mo") |
| Conversion rate | Very high (impulse buy) | Low (2-5% industry avg) |
| Churn | 0% (one-time = no churn) | 40-60%/yr (industry avg) |
| Viral growth | Very high | Moderate |
| Revenue ceiling | Lower per user | Higher per user (if retained) |
| CAC payback | Instant | 1-3 months |

**Verdict:** Stick with one-time pricing. The viral growth advantage and brand differentiation outweigh the lower per-user revenue. If future fundraising requires MRR metrics, consider adding an **optional** cloud sync subscription ($1-2/mo) as an add-on, similar to Obsidian's model ($4/mo for Sync, $8/mo for Publish). The core app remains one-time purchase.

## 8. Recommendations

### Pricing Strategy: Keep $2 / $5 / $20

The current pricing is optimal. It is aggressive enough to be viral, cheap enough to be an impulse buy, and differentiated enough to be the core marketing message. Do not raise prices until the user base exceeds 1M.

### Revenue Maximization Tactics (Without Subscriptions)

1. **Module expansion drives upgrade revenue.** Each new module (MyMeditate, MySleep, MyCalories) gives existing $2 and $5 buyers a reason to upgrade to $20 Complete. Target 2-3 new modules per quarter.

2. **"Pay what you want" tip jar.** After users have been active for 30+ days, offer an optional tip/donation mechanism. Obsidian's model shows power users will pay more than the minimum when they love the product.

3. **Premium add-on: Cloud Sync ($1-2/mo).** Optional cloud sync for users who want cross-device access. This creates a small MRR stream without undermining the one-time core product. Similar to Obsidian's $4/mo Sync service.

4. **Family/household pricing.** $30-35 for a family of 5 (vs. $100 for 5 x $20 individual). Creates a new price tier without subscription.

5. **Education/student pricing.** $10 for students (verified via .edu email). Captures the Quizlet/Anki demographic early.

### Go-to-Market Priority

Based on TAM, competitive vulnerability, and development difficulty:

| Priority | Module | Why First |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **MyFast (free)** | Zero-cost acquisition funnel. Already built. |
| 2 | **MyBudget** | Post-Mint gap. YNAB frustration. Highest willingness to pay. |
| 3 | **MyBooks** | Goodreads exodus. 150M displaced users. |
| 4 | **MyMeditate** | Easiest to build (1/5 difficulty). $2.25B market. Massive price undercut vs. Calm/Headspace at $70/yr. |
| 5 | **MySleep** | $5.49B market. Strong privacy story. Complements MyFast. |
| 6 | **MyCalories** | $6.13B market. 200M+ MyFitnessPal users. Privacy breach history creates opening. |
| 7 | **MyCar** | Weakest competition of any category. Every car owner needs it. |
| 8 | **MyHabits** | Fragmented market, no dominant player. |

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target (Year 1) | Target (Year 3) |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Total installs | 500K | 5M |
| Paid conversion rate | 12-16% | 18-22% |
| Revenue per install | $1.00 | $1.50 |
| Complete tier % of revenue | 40% | 55% |
| Viral coefficient (K-factor) | 0.3 | 0.7 |
| 30-day retention (2+ modules) | 35% | 45% |
| CAC (blended) | $1.50 | $0.80 |
| Total revenue | $500K-$1M | $7.5-$15M |

### The Bottom Line

MyLife's $2/$5/$20 one-time pricing is not a discount strategy. It is a disruption strategy. Like Polymarket's zero fees, DraftKings' $1 bets, and Robinhood's free trades, the pricing itself is the product's most powerful feature. It makes the alternative (paying $100-300/month for 20 separate app subscriptions) feel irrational. In a market drowning in subscription fatigue, one-time pricing is not just differentiated, it is revolutionary.

The combined TAM across MyLife's categories exceeds $150B. Even capturing 0.1% of the US addressable user pool generates $1.5M in one-time revenue. At 1% capture, revenue reaches $15M. The economics work because the marginal cost of serving an additional user of an on-device, privacy-first app is effectively zero: no server costs, no API fees, no data storage, no Plaid connections. Every dollar of revenue beyond development and marketing cost is profit.
