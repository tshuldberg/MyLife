## Executive Summary

The personal finance app market is large, growing rapidly, and recently disrupted by Mint's shutdown in March 2024. Mint's ~20M+ users were funneled to Credit Karma, which lacks budgeting features, creating a massive land-grab opportunity. Monarch Money's 20x user growth and $850M valuation, and Copilot's subscriber surge, prove that displaced users are actively seeking new homes. The subscription tracking sub-market was validated at $1.275B (Truebill/Rocket Money acquisition). Consumers are willing to pay $8-15/month for budgeting tools, and the envelope budgeting niche specifically (YNAB, Goodbudget, EveryDollar) has a devoted user base frustrated by YNAB's repeated price increases. MyBudget's combination of envelope budgeting plus subscription tracking in a privacy-first, offline-first package targets a gap no major competitor fills.

## 1. Envelope Budgeting Market

### YNAB Deep Dive

**Company:** You Need A Budget (YNAB), founded 2004 by Jesse Mecham in Provo, Utah. Private, self-funded with no outside investors.

**Product:** Zero-based (envelope) budgeting app for web, iOS, and Android. Every dollar gets a "job." Direct bank import via Plaid. Real-time syncing across devices.

**Pricing history and controversy:**
- Pre-2017: One-time purchase ($60)
- 2017: Moved to subscription ($50/yr) -- first major backlash
- 2021: Increased to $84/yr ($98.99 for new users) -- doubled legacy pricing
- 2024: Increased to $109/yr ($14.99/mo) -- ongoing community frustration
- Current (2026): $14.99/month or $109/year

**User metrics:**
- ~700K Monthly Active Users (est. based on Sacra/SensorTower data from 2022)
- ~80K monthly App Store downloads, ~$300K monthly App Store revenue (Jan 2026)
- 10M+ total visitors to ynab.com (April 2024)
- 100-250 employees

**Revenue estimates:**
- Various sources estimate $49M-$100M ARR

- Given $14.99/mo pricing and estimated subscriber base, $49-60M ARR is plausible

**Competitive dynamics:**
- Repeated price increases have eroded user trust and driven churn to Monarch, Actual Budget, and other alternatives
- Monarch Money receives 37+ direct mentions as the top YNAB alternative in user forums
- Strong community/methodology lock-in (the "YNAB method" has near-religious following)
- No free tier, 34-day free trial only

## 2. Subscription Tracking Market

### Rocket Money ($1.275B Acquisition)

**The headline deal:** Rocket Companies acquired Truebill for $1.275 billion in cash in December 2021. This remains the defining valuation event for the subscription tracking category.

**At acquisition:**
- 2.5M members, doubling year-over-year
- On track for $100M ARR
- Revenue more than doubled from 2020 to 2021
- Analyzed $50B in monthly transaction volume
- Saved consumers $100M+ since founding

**Current state (as Rocket Money, 2025-2026):**
- 4.1M premium (paying) members as of Q4 2024
- Added 1M+ premium members year-over-year
- Set all-time record for monthly new premium member growth in January 2025
- Ranked #1 finance app in daily App Store downloads (December 2024)
- Premium pricing: $6-12/month (variable, negotiation-based)

**Core value proposition:**
- Automated subscription detection and cancellation
- Bill negotiation (Rocket Money negotiates lower rates on behalf of users)
- Budget tracking, net worth, credit score monitoring
- The acquisition price ($1.275B for ~$100M ARR, ~12.75x revenue) validated the subscription management category as a standalone business worth over a billion dollars

## 3. Post-Mint Market Opportunity

### What Happened

**Timeline:**
- November 1, 2023: Intuit announces Mint shutdown
- March 23, 2024: Mint officially shuts down
- Users directed to Credit Karma (also owned by Intuit)

**The problem:** Credit Karma lacks core budgeting features. No budget creation, no savings goals, no envelope system, no spending categories. It is primarily a credit monitoring and financial product marketplace (loan/card recommendations). This created a massive feature gap for Mint's user base.

**Scale of displaced users:**
- Mint had 20M+ registered users at shutdown
- ~3.6M active users at time of closure (Monarch's estimate)
- These users needed: budget tracking, spending categorization, bank account aggregation, savings goals

### Who Captured the Users

| Competitor | Post-Mint Growth Signal |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Monarch Money** | 20x user growth, went from niche to $850M valuation |
| **Copilot Money** | Grew more in 4 months post-announcement than prior 4 years |
| **Rocket Money** | Hit #1 finance app on App Store, added 1M+ premium members |
| **YNAB** | Benefited but price increases ($109/yr) limited conversion |
| **EveryDollar** | 250K new users/month, Ramsey ecosystem driving awareness |
| **Credit Karma** | Captured some users by default (Intuit redirect) but poor retention due to missing budget features |

### The Remaining Gap

Despite the land-grab, a significant portion of Mint's user base remains underserved:
- Users who want **free or low-cost** budgeting (Mint was free; YNAB is $109/yr, Monarch is $90/yr)
- Users who want **offline-first, privacy-first** (all major competitors require bank linking and cloud sync)
- Users who want **envelope budgeting + subscription tracking** in one app (YNAB does budgeting but not subscription management; Rocket Money does subscriptions but not envelope budgeting)
- Users who are **uncomfortable linking bank accounts** (Goodbudget and Bobby prove this segment exists)

## 4. Market Size and Projections

### Global Personal Finance App Market

Market sizing varies significantly by source and definition, but directionally consistent in showing strong growth:

**Conservative consensus:** The personal finance app market is in the $10-30B range (2025) with 10-20% annual growth.

### US/North America Share

- North America holds 35-38% of the global market
- US alone: ~22.7% global share
- US market estimated at $3-8B depending on definition scope
- Driven by high smartphone penetration, Open Banking API adoption, and post-Mint displacement

### Budgeting App Sub-segment

The budgeting-specific sub-segment (excluding broader fintech like neobanks, payments, investing) is estimated at $2-5B globally, growing at 15-20% CAGR.

### Subscription Economy Context

- US consumers hold an average of 12 paid subscriptions
- Average monthly subscription spend: $219/month (per West Monroe, 2022)
- 42% of consumers have forgotten about at least one subscription they still pay for
- The "subscription fatigue" trend creates demand for management tools

### Consumer Willingness to Pay

- Nearly 80% of budgeting app users engage weekly
- Subscription models account for ~48-50% of app revenue globally
- Higher-priced apps see better Day 35 conversion rates (2.7% median vs 1.5% for low-priced)
- iOS users demonstrate greater willingness to subscribe and higher ARPU
- Successful budgeting apps charge $8-15/month; the market has validated this range

### ARPU Benchmarks

| App | Monthly ARPU (est.) | Annual ARPU |
|-----|-------------------|-------------|
| YNAB | $9.08 | $109 |
| Monarch Money | ~$7.50-12.50 | $89.99 |

| Rocket Money | ~$6-12 | ~$72-144 |
| Goodbudget | ~$6.67-10 | $80-$120 |

## Key Takeaways for MyLife

### 1. The Envelope + Subscription Combo Is Unoccupied

No major competitor combines envelope budgeting with integrated subscription tracking. YNAB does envelopes but not subscription management. Rocket Money does subscriptions but not envelope budgeting. MyBudget can own this intersection.

### 2. Privacy-First Is a Real Differentiator

Every major competitor (YNAB, Monarch, Copilot, Rocket Money, PocketGuard) requires bank account linking and cloud data storage. The only privacy-first options (Goodbudget, Bobby) are feature-limited. MyBudget's SQLite-local, zero-network architecture is a genuine differentiator for the privacy-conscious segment. This is especially relevant post-Mint, where Intuit's data practices were a major concern.

### 3. Price Sensitivity Creates an Opening

YNAB's repeated price increases ($50 -> $84 -> $109/yr) have created a frustrated user base actively seeking alternatives. MyBudget at $4.99/mo ($29.99/yr as part of MyLife Pro) undercuts every major competitor by 50-75%. The bundle pricing (10 modules for $29.99/yr vs YNAB's $109/yr for one app) is a strong value proposition.

### 4. The Subscription Tracking Market Is Validated at $1B+

Rocket Money's $1.275B acquisition proved subscription tracking alone can support a billion-dollar business. MyBudget's 215-entry subscription catalog and integrated tracking adds this value as a feature within a broader budgeting app rather than a standalone product.

### 5. The Post-Mint Window Is Still Open

Despite Monarch's growth, 15-20M+ former Mint users remain unaccounted for. Credit Karma did not satisfy their budgeting needs. The market is still absorbing displaced users, and new entrants can capture share if they differentiate on price, privacy, or feature combination.

### 6. Offline-First Is Underserved at Scale

All growth-stage competitors (Monarch, Copilot, Rocket Money) are cloud-first. The offline-first, on-device segment has only indie-scale products (Goodbudget, Bobby). MyBudget can be the first well-funded offline-first budgeting app.

### 7. Revenue Multiple Benchmarks

- Rocket Money: acquired at ~12.75x ARR ($1.275B / ~$100M)
- Monarch Money: valued at ~67x ARR ($850M / $12.6M) -- growth-stage premium
- These multiples suggest that even modest ARR ($5-10M) in this category can support meaningful valuations

### 8. Competitive Moat Opportunities

- **Data portability:** Offer easy import from YNAB, Mint backups, Monarch, and bank CSV exports
- **Bundle economics:** MyLife Pro at $29.99/yr makes MyBudget effectively free compared to $109/yr for YNAB alone
- **No recurring API costs:** Privacy-first/offline-first means no Plaid fees ($0.25-$3.00 per bank connection/month), which is a major margin advantage over competitors who spend heavily on data aggregation
