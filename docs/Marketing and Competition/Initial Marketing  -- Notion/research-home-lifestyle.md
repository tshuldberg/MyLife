# Home & Lifestyle App Market Research

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Scope:** MyHomes (PropTech), MyCar (Vehicle Maintenance), MyGarden (Plant Care), MyPets (Pet Care), MyCloset (Wardrobe Management)

---

## Executive Summary

The Home & Lifestyle category spans five potential MyLife modules targeting massive, established markets. Real estate tech (PropTech) is by far the largest opportunity at $45B+ globally ($17.6B North America), anchored by a ~$90B US commission pool and public companies generating $2.6B-$7B in annual revenue. The pet care industry ($157B projected 2025) is the second-largest underlying market, with the pet tech segment at $15-20B and a landmark $2.3B Rover acquisition validating marketplace models. Plant care apps represent a fast-growing niche ($1-3B market) with Planta and PictureThis proving subscription viability. Vehicle maintenance tracking is a utility-first category with fragmented competition and no dominant player. Wardrobe/closet tech is the smallest segment ($242M-$1.5B depending on scope) but shows strong Gen Z/millennial adoption trends.

MyHomes is the highest-stakes module but faces entrenched incumbents with billions in revenue. MyCar and MyPets are the most natural fits for MyLife's privacy-first, on-device model, as they require no network effects or marketplace dynamics. MyGarden and MyCloset are lifestyle add-ons that strengthen suite breadth.

## 1. Real Estate Tech (PropTech)

### Market Size

- **Global PropTech market:** $45.7B in 2025, projected to reach $198.5B by 2035 (CAGR 16.1%)
- **North America PropTech:** $17.58B in 2025 (38.7% global share)
- **US existing home sales:** ~4.35M annualized rate (Dec 2025), median price $405,400
- **Implied US transaction volume:** ~$1.76T annually at current pace
- **Total US commission pool:** At 5.44% average commission rate on ~$1.76T in transactions, the US real estate commission pool is roughly **$96B/year**
- **NAR Settlement impact (Aug 2024):** Commissions have not declined meaningfully; average total rate edged up to 5.44% from 5.32% pre-settlement. Buyer agent commissions ticked up to 2.40% in Q1 2025.

### Public Company Financials

#### Zillow (Z/ZG)
- **FY2025 Revenue:** $2.6B (+16% YoY)
- **Net Income:** $23M (first profit; up from -$112M loss in 2024)
- **Adj. EBITDA:** $622M (24% margin, +180bps YoY)
- **Monthly Unique Users:** 221M average (Q4 2025, +8% YoY)
- **Revenue Breakdown:**
  - Residential (Premier Agent): $1.704B (+7%)
  - Rentals: $630M (+39%) -- fastest growing segment
  - Mortgages: $199M (+37%)
- **Key insight:** Zillow monetizes primarily through Premier Agent (agent lead referrals/advertising), rentals listings, and mortgage origination. Rentals is the growth engine.

#### Redfin (RDFN) -- Acquired by Rocket Companies
- **FY2024 Revenue:** $1.04B (+7% YoY)
- **Q1 2025 Revenue:** $221M (-2% YoY)
- **Net Loss:** $92.5M (Q1 2025)
- **Acquisition:** Rocket Companies announced acquisition of Redfin on March 10, 2025. Redfin subsequently delisted.
- **Key insight:** Redfin's discount brokerage model (1% listing fee) struggled to achieve profitability independently. Rocket's acquisition creates a mortgage-to-brokerage vertical.

#### Opendoor (OPEN)
- **FY2025 Revenue:** $4.4B (-15.2% YoY)
- **Q2 2025:** First quarter of Adj. EBITDA profitability since 2022
- **Q4 2025:** $736M revenue, -19.6% QoQ
- **Key insight:** iBuying is a high-revenue, low-margin business. Revenue is primarily home sales proceeds, not software/services. The model remains capital-intensive and cyclically vulnerable.

#### Compass (COMP)
- **FY2025 Revenue:** $7.0B (record year)
- **Adj. EBITDA:** $293.4M (record)
- **Operating Cash Flow:** $217M (record, 8 consecutive positive quarters)
- **Principal Agents:** 21,190 (+19.4% YoY, 96.8% retention)
- **Q4 GTV:** $65.6B (+21.6% YoY)
- **GAAP Net Loss:** -$58.5M (stock comp + merger costs)
- **Key insight:** Compass is an agent-first brokerage platform. $7B revenue sounds massive but most of it is agent commission pass-through. The real business is the technology platform that attracts and retains agents. Acquired Christie's International Real Estate in 2025.

#### Homes.com / CoStar Group
- **FY2025 Residential Revenue:** $1.46B (+19.7% from $1.22B)
- **Monthly Unique Users:** 108M average across 17 brands (Homes.com Network)
- **Agent Subscribers:** 31,000+ generating $100M annualized run rate
- **Market Position:** #2 US residential portal (behind Zillow), fastest growing
- **Key insight:** CoStar is investing aggressively (billions in marketing) to challenge Zillow's dominance. Their strategy is to give listings directly to agents rather than selling leads.

#### Realtor.com / Move Inc (News Corp)
- **FY2025 Revenue (ending June 2025):** $552M (+1%)
- **Monthly Unique Users:** 66-72M (declining)
- **Lead Volume:** -9% YoY decline
- **Key insight:** Realtor.com is losing ground to both Zillow and Homes.com. The official NAR-affiliated brand hasn't translated into traffic dominance.

#### Offerpad (OPAD)
- **FY2025 Revenue:** ~$568M (estimated from quarterly reports), down significantly YoY
- **Q1 2025:** $161M (-44% YoY)
- **Q4 2025:** $114.1M (-35% YoY)
- **Key insight:** iBuying continues to contract. Offerpad pivoting to renovation services ($27M revenue, +50% YoY) as a margin-positive adjacency.

### Revenue Models in Real Estate Tech

| Company | Primary Revenue Source | Model |
|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Zillow | Premier Agent (advertising/leads) | Agent pays for buyer leads |
| Redfin | Brokerage commissions | Discount brokerage (1% listing fee) |
| Opendoor | Home buy/sell spread | iBuying (capital-intensive) |
| Compass | Agent commission splits | Tech-enabled brokerage |
| Homes.com | Agent subscriptions | Direct listing-to-agent model |
| Realtor.com | Agent/lender advertising | Lead generation |

### MyHomes Implications

MyHomes entering this space faces extraordinary competition from companies with $500M-$7B in revenue. The opportunity for MyLife is not to compete head-on with Zillow but to provide a **personal real estate management tool**: mortgage tracking, home maintenance schedules, property value monitoring, renovation planning, and neighborhood intelligence. This "homeowner OS" angle has no dominant incumbent and sidesteps the agent/listing marketplace entirely.

---

## 2. Vehicle Maintenance Apps

### Market Landscape

The car maintenance app market is estimated at roughly **$1B** (broader automotive app market is larger). The space is fragmented with no clear market leader by revenue.

### Key Competitors

| App | Downloads | Model | Key Features |
|-----|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Drivvo** | 10M+ (Google Play) | Freemium | Fuel, maintenance, cost tracking, fleet management (up to 100 vehicles) |
| **Fuelly** | 1M+ | Free | Fuel economy tracking, community MPG data |
| **Jerry** | N/A | Insurance broker (50-state licensed) | AI insurance comparison + maintenance reminders. $242M total funding, $450M valuation (2021), $35M ARR |
| **AUTOsist** | 100K+ | Freemium (paid for fleets) | Full maintenance management, personal + fleet |
| **CARFAX Car Care** | 1M+ (Google Play) | Free (CARFAX ecosystem) | Service history, recall alerts, maintenance reminders |
| **Mileage Tracker (Everlance)** | 1M+ | Freemium | Mileage tracking for tax deductions, expense logging |

### Market Dynamics

- **No dominant player:** Unlike fitness (Strava) or budgeting (YNAB), there is no category-defining car maintenance app
- **Jerry is the best-funded ($242M)** but focused on insurance brokerage, not pure maintenance tracking
- **CARFAX** has brand recognition but the app is a free add-on to their vehicle history report business
- **Broader automotive services market:** $54B in 2020, projected $175B by 2030
- **Opportunity:** A privacy-first, on-device car maintenance tracker with no insurance upsells or data selling would differentiate strongly

### MyCar Implications

MyCar is a natural MyLife module. The category has weak competition, no dominant incumbent, and strong user need (every car owner needs maintenance tracking). Key features: maintenance log, fuel tracking, cost-per-mile, insurance/registration reminders, recall alerts (via NHTSA API), and multi-vehicle support. The on-device, no-account model directly addresses privacy concerns that plague apps like Jerry (which monetize user data for insurance leads).

## 3. Plant Care & Garden Apps

### Market Size

- **Plant identification apps market:** $1.04B (2021), projected $2.87B by 2033 (CAGR 8.8%)
- **Broader plant care app category:** Estimated $1-3B depending on scope definition

### Key Competitors

| App | Users/Downloads | Revenue | Model |
|-----|----------------|---------|-------|
| **Planta** | 7M users, 32M plants tracked | ~91.4M SEK (~$8.7M) annual (2023). ~$300K/month US stores (2025 est.) | Freemium, $7.99/mo premium |
| **PictureThis** | 100M+ downloads | ~$3M/month US iOS alone (est. 2025) | Freemium, $29.99/yr |
| **Greg** | 1M+ | N/A | Freemium |
| **Gardenize** | 500K+ | N/A | Freemium |
| **SmartPlant** | 100K+ | N/A | Freemium |

### Market Dynamics

- **PictureThis dominates by volume** (100M+ downloads) with strong monetization through plant identification AI
- **Planta leads in user engagement** (7M users actively tracking 32M plants) with a care-focused experience
- **AI/camera identification** is the primary acquisition driver for both PictureThis and Planta
- **Subscription models are proven:** Both top apps charge $7-30/year and generate meaningful revenue
- **Seasonal usage patterns:** Spring/summer peaks, winter troughs

### MyGarden Implications

A MyGarden module would compete in a market with proven subscription viability but strong incumbents in PictureThis and Planta. The MyLife advantage is bundling: garden tracking alongside home maintenance (MyHomes), pet care (MyPets), and other lifestyle modules. Key differentiator would be privacy-first plant tracking without the data collection that PictureThis (a Chinese-owned company) employs. However, this module would need plant identification AI to be competitive, which may require network calls, conflicting with offline-first philosophy.

## 4. Pet Care & Management

### Market Size

- **Total US pet industry:** $152B (2024 actual), $157B projected 2025 (APPA)
  - Pet food/treats: $65.8B
  - Vet care/products: $39.8B
  - Supplies/OTC: $34.3B
  - Services: $13.5B
- **Pet tech market:** $15-20B globally in 2025, projected $52.9B by 2035 (CAGR 12%)
- **US pet care apps market:** $868M-$2B in 2025 (estimates vary), projected $7B by 2033 (CAGR 15-18%)
- **Pet ownership:** 66% of US households own a pet (~86.9M homes)

### Key Competitors

| Company | Type | Revenue/Valuation | Key Metrics |
|---------|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Rover** | Pet sitting marketplace | **Acquired by Blackstone for $2.3B** (Feb 2024) | World's largest pet care marketplace. Founded 2011, Seattle. $11/share, 61% premium. |
| **Wag! (PET)** | Dog walking/pet services | FY2024: $70.5M rev (-16% YoY). FY2025 guidance: $84-88M | Strategic review announced; sold Furscription business. Net loss $17.6M (2024). Adj. EBITDA target $2-4M (2025). |
| **BARK (BARK)** | Pet subscription box | FY2025 (ending Mar 2025): $484M rev (-1.2%). First full year positive Adj. EBITDA ($5.4M) | BarkBox subscription model. Commerce revenue up 27%. Gross margin 62.4%. |
| **PetDesk** | Vet appointment/management | $50-100M est. revenue | 8,000+ clinic partners. Series B ($12M raised). Launched AI-powered PetDesk Scribe (2025). |
| **11Pets** | Pet care log | Free | Basic pet health/care tracking. Small user base. |

### Rover Acquisition Deep Dive

Blackstone's $2.3B acquisition of Rover (completed Feb 2024) is the landmark pet tech deal:
- **Valuation:** $2.3B all-cash, $11/share (61% premium to 90-day VWAP)
- **Strategic rationale:** Blackstone sees significant growth runway as pet owners demand quality care, flexibility, convenience
- **Model:** Marketplace connecting pet parents with sitters/walkers. Revenue from service fees on bookings.
- **Post-acquisition:** Now private, no longer reporting public financials

### Wag! Struggles

Wag! (ticker: PET) illustrates the challenges of the pet services marketplace model:
- Revenue declining (-16% in 2024, continued pressure in 2025)
- Strategic review exploring sale, merger, or partnership
- Sold Furscription business to MWI Veterinary Supply (July 2025)
- Market cap has declined dramatically from SPAC debut

### MyPets Implications

MyPets is well-suited for MyLife. The $157B pet industry has massive consumer spending, but the pet care **tracking app** niche (vet records, medication schedules, feeding logs, weight tracking) is surprisingly underserved by quality apps. Most incumbents are either marketplaces (Rover, Wag!) or vet practice management tools (PetDesk), not personal pet health journals. The privacy-first, on-device model aligns perfectly: pet owners want to track vaccinations, medications, vet visits, and health metrics without data harvesting. No marketplace dynamics needed, just clean utility.

## 5. Wardrobe & Fashion Tech

### Market Size

- **Wardrobe app market:** $242M in 2025, projected $399M by 2032 (CAGR 8.8%) -- conservative estimate
- **Broader virtual closet market:** $1.5B in 2025, projected growth to $8.5B by 2032 (CAGR 12.7%) -- aggressive estimate
- **Capsule wardrobe app segment:** Smaller niche within the above

### Key Competitors

| App | Focus | Model | Differentiator |
|-----|-------|-------|---------------|
| **Cladwell** | Minimalist outfit planning | Freemium | Sustainability focus, personalized outfit recommendations from existing wardrobe |
| **Stylebook** | Digital closet organizer | Paid ($3.99) | Most established iOS closet app, no subscription |
| **Acloset** | Virtual closet | Freemium | Strong Android presence, social sharing |
| **Whering** | Wardrobe digitization | Freemium | AI-powered outfit suggestions, resale integration, sustainability metrics |
| **Smart Closet** | Outfit planning | Freemium | Weather-based outfit suggestions |

### Market Dynamics

- **No dominant player:** The wardrobe app space is fragmented with mostly indie/small-team apps
- **Sustainability narrative:** Strong tailwind from conscious consumerism, capsule wardrobe movement
- **Gen Z/millennial adoption:** Primary demographics driving growth
- **Emerging features:** Virtual try-on (AR), cost-per-wear analytics, resale marketplace integration
- **Challenge:** Wardrobe digitization requires users to photograph every clothing item, creating high onboarding friction

### MyCloset Implications

MyCloset is the weakest standalone proposition among the five modules but adds valuable suite breadth. The market is small ($242M-$1.5B) with no breakout app. The onboarding friction (photographing clothes) limits adoption. However, as a bundled MyLife module, it adds lifestyle completeness and appeals to the same privacy-conscious, organization-minded user who would use MyBudget and MyBooks. The privacy angle matters here because wardrobe data reveals shopping habits and brand preferences that ad-tech companies would love to monetize.

## Market Size Summary

| Market | 2025 Size | 2030-2035 Projection | Growth Rate |

## Key Takeaways for MyLife

### 1. MyHomes: Pivot from Zillow Competitor to Homeowner OS
Competing with Zillow ($2.6B revenue, 221M monthly users) as a listing/marketplace platform is not viable for a privacy-first indie app. Instead, MyHomes should target the **homeowner management** niche: mortgage amortization tracking, home maintenance scheduling, renovation budgets, property value monitoring (via public APIs), insurance/warranty tracking, and neighborhood data. This "personal real estate dashboard" has no dominant incumbent and dovetails with MyBudget (mortgage payments) and MyCar (home = biggest asset management).

### 2. MyCar: Low Competition, High Utility
The vehicle maintenance space has **no category winner**. Drivvo has scale (10M+ downloads) but is a Brazilian company with basic UX. Jerry has funding ($242M) but is an insurance broker, not a maintenance tracker. CARFAX Car Care is free but limited. MyCar can win by being the best-designed, privacy-first car maintenance tracker with multi-vehicle support, cost analytics, and recall alerts. Low development cost, high suite value.

### 3. MyPets: Underserved Tracking Niche in a $157B Industry
The $157B US pet industry has massive spend but the personal pet health tracking app niche is strangely vacant. Rover ($2.3B) and Wag! are marketplaces, not trackers. PetDesk serves veterinary practices, not consumers directly. A clean pet health journal (vet records, medications, vaccinations, weight, feeding schedules) fills a real gap. Multi-pet support is essential (average pet household owns 1.5-2 pets).

### 4. MyGarden: Proven Subscriptions, but AI Required
Planta and PictureThis prove that plant care apps can monetize via subscriptions ($8-30/year). However, plant identification AI is table stakes and requires network calls or an on-device ML model, which adds complexity. Best positioned as a Phase 3+ module after core modules are established.

### 5. MyCloset: Suite Breadth, Not Standalone Viability
The wardrobe app market is too small ($242M) and the onboarding friction too high (photographing every item) for MyCloset to be a priority module. However, it adds lifestyle completeness to the suite and appeals to the same demographic. Best positioned as a future expansion module.

### Priority Ranking for MyLife Integration

| Priority | Module | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **MyCar** | Lowest competition, highest privacy-fit, fastest to build, every car owner needs it |
| 2 | **MyPets** | Underserved niche in massive market, natural on-device fit, no marketplace needed |
| 3 | **MyHomes** | Huge market but requires "homeowner OS" pivot, not listing platform. Synergizes with MyBudget. |
| 4 | **MyGarden** | Proven subscription model, but needs plant ID AI. Better as Phase 3+ module. |
| 5 | **MyCloset** | Smallest market, highest onboarding friction. Suite breadth add-on only. |

### Public Company Performance Scorecard

| Ticker | Company | FY2025 Revenue | Profitable? | Trend |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Z/ZG | Zillow | $2.6B | Yes ($23M net) | Accelerating (rentals +39%) |
| RDFN | Redfin | $1.04B (FY2024) | No | Acquired by Rocket Companies |
| OPEN | Opendoor | $4.4B | No | Declining revenue, approaching profitability |
| COMP | Compass | $7.0B | No (GAAP) / Yes (Adj. EBITDA) | Record year, agent growth +19% |
| CSGP | CoStar (Homes.com) | $1.46B (residential) | Investing phase | Fastest-growing portal |
| OPAD | Offerpad | ~$568M | No | iBuying contracting, pivoting to renovation |
| PET | Wag! | $70.5M (2024) | No | Declining, strategic review |
| BARK | BARK | $484M | Adj. EBITDA positive (first time) | Stabilizing after years of losses |
