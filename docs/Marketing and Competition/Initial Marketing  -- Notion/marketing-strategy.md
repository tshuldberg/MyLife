## 1. Positioning & Messaging

### Core Positioning Statement

**For** privacy-conscious individuals who use multiple personal apps,
**MyLife is** a unified app hub
**that** replaces 20+ standalone subscriptions with a single $20 one-time purchase,
**unlike** YNAB, Surfline, Strava, and dozens of other apps that charge $5-15/month each and harvest your data,
**MyLife** keeps all data on your device, costs 97% less, and gets better with every module you enable.

### The "App Subscription Tax" Narrative

This is MyLife's central marketing narrative. It frames the problem, positions the villain, and makes MyLife the hero.

**The Pitch (30-second version):**
"The average person spends $820/year on app subscriptions they barely use. Each one has its own login, its own data silo, and its own terms of service for your personal data. MyLife replaces all of them for a one-time $20 purchase. Your data stays on your device. No accounts. No subscriptions. No surveillance."

**The Pitch (10-second version):**
"20 apps. $20. Once. Your data stays yours."

**The Pitch (tweet-length):**
"I replaced $820/year in app subscriptions with a single $20 purchase. MyLife gives you budgeting, book tracking, fasting, workouts, recipes, habits, and 14 more apps. All on-device. Zero accounts. Zero subscriptions."

### Key Messages by Audience Segment

| Segment | Pain Point | MyLife Message | Lead Module |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Budget-conscious millennials** | Subscription fatigue, $200+/mo on apps | "Stop paying the app subscription tax. $20 for everything, forever." | MyBudget |
| **Privacy advocates** | Data harvesting, breaches, account deletions | "Your data. Your device. No exceptions." | MyCycle, MyMeds, MyMood |
| **Goodreads refugees** | API shutdown, privacy erosion, stagnant UX | "Track your reading life without Amazon watching." | MyBooks |
| **YNAB defectors** | Price increases ($50 to $109/yr), subscription fatigue | "Envelope budgeting for $2, not $109/year." | MyBudget |
| **Fitness trackers** | Paying $80-160/yr for single-purpose apps | "Workouts + surf + fasting + habits in one app for $20." | MyWorkouts, MyFast |
| **Health-conscious women** | Post-Dobbs cycle data privacy concerns | "Cycle tracking that never leaves your phone. Period." | MyCycle |
| **Parents / families** | Managing multiple app subscriptions for family | "One purchase covers the whole family's app needs." | MyBudget, MyRecipes, MyHabits |
| **Students** | Can't afford $96/yr for Quizlet + $50/yr for StoryGraph + ... | "Every study tool you need for the price of one lunch." | MyFlash, MyBooks, MyWords |

### "Against" Positioning

MyLife succeeds by being explicitly against three things:

**1. Against Subscription Fatigue**
- "You don't rent your calculator. Why rent your budget app?"
- "One-time purchase. No monthly drain on your wallet. No forgetting to cancel."
- Data point: 42% of consumers have forgotten about subscriptions they still pay for

**2. Against Privacy Violations**
- "Every app on your phone is another company with your data. MyLife is zero companies with your data."
- "We can't sell your data because we never have it."
- Data points: MyFitnessPal breached 150M accounts. Dictionary.com deleted all user accounts. 61% of period trackers have code vulnerabilities.

**3. Against App Bloat**
- "20 apps, 20 logins, 20 privacy policies. Or one app, zero logins, zero cloud."
- "Your home screen shouldn't look like a subscription invoice."
- Data point: Average US consumer has 12 paid subscriptions at $219/month

### Tagline Options

1. **"Your life. Your device. Your rules."** (privacy-first)
2. **"20 apps. $20. Once."** (value-first)
3. **"The app that replaces all the apps."** (simplicity-first)
4. **"Everything you need. Nothing you don't."** (anti-bloat)
5. **"Own your apps. Own your data."** (ownership-first)

**Recommended primary:** "20 apps. $20. Once." -- it is memorable, shareable, and communicates the core value in six words.

## 2. Launch Strategy

### Phase Overview

| Phase | Timeline | Focus | Key Metric |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|
| Pre-Launch | Weeks 1-8 | Waitlist, content, community seeding | Waitlist signups |
| Soft Launch | Weeks 9-12 | TestFlight/beta, early feedback | Active testers, NPS |
| Launch Day | Week 13 | Product Hunt, PR, social blitz | Day-1 installs |
| Post-Launch | Weeks 14-26 | Word-of-mouth flywheel, content marketing | Organic installs, conversion rate |
| Growth | Months 7-12 | Paid acquisition, partnerships, new modules | Revenue, retention |

### Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-8)

**Waitlist Strategy**

Build a waitlist that creates urgency and provides launch-day momentum.

- **Landing page:** Single page with the $820 vs $20 comparison graphic, module showcase, and email capture
- **Incentive tiers:**
  - Sign up = early access
  - Refer 3 friends = unlock a free module on launch
  - Refer 10 friends = get MyLife Complete free
- **Target:** 10,000 waitlist signups before launch

**Tactics:**
1. **Reddit seeding** (Weeks 1-4)
   - Post in r/privacy, r/ynab, r/personalfinance, r/books, r/intermittentfasting, r/surfing, r/fitness
   - Share genuine value posts about subscription costs, then mention MyLife in comments
   - Create a "How much do you spend on app subscriptions?" survey post
   - Budget: $0

2. **Content marketing kickoff** (Weeks 1-8)
   - Launch blog with 3 anchor posts:
     - "The App Subscription Tax: How You're Spending $820/Year Without Realizing It"
     - "Why Your Personal Data Should Never Leave Your Device"
     - "The Goodreads Exodus: Where 150M Readers Are Going Next"
   - Budget: $0 (written in-house)

3. **Community building** (Weeks 3-8)
   - Create Discord server for beta testers
   - Invite privacy-focused tech writers to preview
   - Seed conversations on Hacker News, Indie Hackers
   - Budget: $0

4. **Influencer outreach** (Weeks 4-8)
   - Identify 20-30 tech/privacy/productivity YouTubers (50K-500K subscribers)
   - Send personalized pitches with early access
   - Target channels: privacy reviewers, "apps I use" creators, personal finance educators
   - Budget: $500-1,000 for product samples/gifts

### Soft Launch (Weeks 9-12)

**TestFlight / Beta Distribution**

- Open beta to first 1,000 waitlist signups
- In-app feedback mechanism
- Weekly beta updates addressing top issues
- Build testimonial pipeline from beta testers

**Key actions:**
1. Fix critical bugs from beta feedback
2. Record "first impressions" video testimonials from beta users
3. Prepare App Store listing (screenshots, description, keywords)
4. Write and schedule launch day content
5. Prepare Product Hunt listing materials

### Launch Day (Week 13)

**Product Hunt Launch**

- Schedule for Tuesday or Wednesday (highest engagement days)
- Prepare: compelling tagline, 5+ screenshots, demo video (60 seconds), maker's story
- Engage all day: respond to every comment within 30 minutes
- Mobilize waitlist to upvote and engage authentically
- Target: Top 5 Product of the Day

**Launch Day Channels (simultaneous):**

| Channel | Action | Timing |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Product Hunt | Launch listing + all-day engagement | 12:01 AM PT |
| Hacker News | "Show HN: I built 20 privacy-first apps for $20" | 9 AM ET |
| Reddit | Posts in 5+ relevant subreddits | Staggered 10 AM-4 PM |
| Twitter/X | Launch thread with $820 vs $20 graphic | 10 AM ET |
| Email | Waitlist announcement with exclusive early pricing | 8 AM ET |
| Blog | "Why I Built MyLife" founder story | 8 AM ET |
| YouTube | 2-minute product walkthrough video | 10 AM ET |
| App Store | Listing goes live | 12:01 AM PT |
| Discord | Celebration + live Q&A | All day |

**Launch Day Offer:**
First 48 hours: MyLife Complete for $15 (25% off the $20 price). Creates urgency without undercutting the already aggressive pricing.

### Post-Launch (Weeks 14-26)

**Word-of-Mouth Flywheel**

The $20 price point is inherently viral. Users will screenshot the pricing comparison and share it. Lean into this:

1. **In-app share prompts:** After 7 days of active use, prompt: "You've saved $X compared to standalone app subscriptions. Share MyLife with a friend?"
2. **App Store review requests:** After 14 days of use across 2+ modules
3. **Referral program activation** (see Section 7)

**Content cadence:**
- 2 blog posts per week (see Section 5)
- 1 "MyLife vs [Competitor]" comparison page per week (see Section 9)
- Weekly changelog updates in-app
- Monthly "module spotlight" email

**Module stagger strategy:**
- Do not launch all 20 modules simultaneously
- Launch with 8-10 core modules, then release 1-2 new modules per month
- Each new module is a mini-launch moment (blog post, social, email, in-app notification)
- This creates sustained press coverage: "MyLife adds meditation tracking" is a new story every month

### Which Modules to Lead With

Based on market research, competitive vulnerability, and development readiness:

| Priority | Module | Why Lead With It |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **MyFast** (free) | Zero-cost acquisition funnel. 93M+ global fasting app users. Free hook. |
| 2 | **MyBudget** | Post-Mint gap (15-20M displaced users). YNAB frustration ($109/yr). Highest willingness to pay. |
| 3 | **MyBooks** | Goodreads exodus (150M+ stagnant users). Active migration happening now. |
| 4 | **MyHabits** | Fragmented market with no dominant player. Low development cost. |
| 5 | **MyRecipes** | Yummly shutdown created displaced users. Paprika model validated. |
| 6 | **MyWorkouts** | $10.6B market. Hevy proves bootstrapped trackers succeed. |
| 7 | **MyCar** | Weakest competition of any category. Every car owner needs it. |
| 8 | **MySurf** | Surfline's $120/yr creates disruption window. Strong niche community. |

**Phase 2 modules (Months 3-6):** MyCycle, MyMeds, MyMood, MyHomes
**Phase 3 modules (Months 6-12):** MyMeditate, MySleep, MyCalories, MyContacts, MyVoice, MyJournal, MyNotes

---

## 3. Growth Channels

### Organic Growth

**3.1 SEO (Programmatic)**

Create comparison and alternative pages at scale for every module vs every competitor:

| Page Type | Example | Target Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Alternative (singular) | mylife.app/alternative/ynab | "YNAB alternative" | 5,400 |
| Alternative (singular) | mylife.app/alternative/goodreads | "Goodreads alternative" | 12,000 |
| Alternative (singular) | mylife.app/alternative/surfline | "Surfline alternative" | 2,900 |
| Alternative (singular) | mylife.app/alternative/strava | "Strava alternative" | 4,400 |
| Alternatives (plural) | mylife.app/alternatives/fasting-apps | "best fasting apps" | 8,100 |
| Alternatives (plural) | mylife.app/alternatives/budget-apps | "best budget apps" | 18,000 |
| Vs page | mylife.app/vs/ynab | "MyLife vs YNAB" | Build over time |
| Calculator | mylife.app/tools/subscription-cost | "app subscription calculator" | Build over time |

**Target: 50+ SEO pages in the first 6 months.** Each page targets a specific competitor keyword and positions MyLife as the privacy-first, one-time-purchase alternative.

**Estimated timeline to SEO impact:** 3-6 months for initial rankings, 6-12 months for meaningful organic traffic.

**3.2 Content Marketing**

See Section 5 for detailed content plan.

**3.3 Reddit & Communities**

Reddit is MyLife's single most important organic channel because:
- Privacy-focused users live on Reddit (r/privacy has 1.7M members)
- App recommendation threads are constantly active
- Subscription fatigue posts regularly go viral
- The "I replaced X with Y" format thrives on Reddit

**Target subreddits:**

| Subreddit | Members | Relevance | Module |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| r/privacy | 1.7M | Core audience | All |
| r/personalfinance | 18M | Budget-conscious users | MyBudget |
| r/ynab | 150K | YNAB defectors | MyBudget |
| r/books | 25M | Book trackers | MyBooks |
| r/52book | 150K | Active readers | MyBooks |
| r/intermittentfasting | 1.1M | Fasters | MyFast |
| r/surfing | 250K | Surfers | MySurf |
| r/fitness | 11M | Fitness trackers | MyWorkouts |
| r/selfimprovement | 2.5M | Habit builders | MyHabits |
| r/cooking | 25M | Home cooks | MyRecipes |
| r/frugal | 2.3M | Cost-conscious | All (pricing story) |
| r/degoogle | 450K | Privacy-first tech | All |

**Reddit strategy:**
- Never post overt ads. Provide genuine value first.
- Share the "$820 vs $20" comparison organically
- Respond helpfully to "what app should I use for X" threads
- Post in r/privacy about offline-first architecture
- Create "I built this" posts in r/SideProject and r/IndieHackers
- Budget: $0 (purely organic engagement)

### Viral Growth

**3.4 The "$20 for Everything" Message**

The pricing itself is the viral mechanic. When someone discovers MyLife costs $20 one-time for 20+ apps, their natural reaction is to tell someone.

**Viral amplification tactics:**
1. **Shareable pricing graphic:** Create a visual comparing 10 standalone app subscriptions ($820/yr) vs MyLife ($20 once). Optimize for Twitter/Instagram sharing.
2. **In-app share card:** After first week of use, generate a personalized "savings card" showing estimated annual savings based on which modules the user enabled.
3. **App Store screenshots:** Lead with the pricing comparison, not features. The price is the feature.
4. **TikTok/Reels format:** 15-second video: "POV: You find out you've been paying $820/year for apps you can get for $20"

**Estimated viral coefficient target:** K-factor of 0.3-0.5 in Year 1 (each user brings in 0.3-0.5 new users).

### Referral Growth

See Section 7 for detailed referral program design.

### Paid Growth

**3.5 App Store Search Ads**

- Bid on competitor brand terms: "YNAB", "Surfline", "Goodreads", "Strava"
- Bid on category terms: "budget app", "fasting app", "book tracker"
- Create per-module ad groups with module-specific screenshots
- Budget: $2,000-5,000/month initially, scaling based on ROAS
- Target CPA: $1-3 per install (at $20 price point, 3x+ ROAS at $3 CPA with 16% conversion)

**3.6 Targeted Community Ads**

- Reddit ads in target subreddits (r/privacy, r/personalfinance, r/books)
- Podcast sponsorships on privacy/personal finance/productivity shows
- Budget: $1,000-3,000/month
- Focus on shows with 10K-100K listeners (better CAC than top shows)

**3.7 Influencer Seeding (Borrowed Channels)**

The TRMNL playbook: send free access to influencers without asking for coverage. If the product is good, they'll talk about it.

| Influencer Type | Target Count | Expected Conversion | Budget |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Tech reviewers (YouTube 50K-500K) | 20 | 3-5 reviews | $500 (time/outreach) |
| Privacy advocates (YouTube/blog) | 15 | 5-8 mentions | $300 |
| Personal finance creators | 10 | 2-4 features | $200 |
| Productivity/app reviewers | 15 | 4-6 features | $300 |
| **Total** | **60** | **14-23 organic mentions** | **$1,300** |

## 4. Psychological Hooks

### Anchoring: Show the Pain First

**Always show the $820/year number before the $20 number.**

The anchoring effect means the first number people encounter sets their expectation. By showing the cumulative cost of standalone subscriptions first, $20 feels impossibly cheap rather than just cheap.

**Implementation:**
- Landing page hero: "$820/year in app subscriptions" (large, red, crossed out) followed by "$20, once" (large, green)
- App Store description opens with: "Americans spend an average of $820/year on app subscriptions..."
- Every comparison page leads with competitor pricing before showing MyLife's price
- Social media posts always lead with the expensive number

### Loss Aversion: Frame What They're Losing

People feel losses twice as strongly as equivalent gains. Frame MyLife not as "you gain 20 apps" but as "you're losing $800/year right now."

**Copy examples:**
- "You're paying $68/month for apps that could be free."
- "Every month you wait, you're losing another $68 to the app subscription tax."
- "Stop paying $109/year for budgeting. You already earned that money. Keep it."
- "Your fasting data, mood logs, and cycle data are on someone else's server right now."

### Social Proof: User Counts and Migration Stories

Build social proof from Day 1 by tracking and displaying:
- Total modules enabled across all users
- "X people switched from YNAB this week"
- Beta tester testimonials (collect during soft launch)
- App Store rating and review count

**Social proof formats:**
- Counter on website: "12,847 app subscriptions replaced"
- Module-specific: "4,230 readers tracking books with MyBooks"
- Savings-focused: "$2.4M in subscription fees saved by MyLife users"

### Bundling Effect: Perceived Value Multiplication

The perceived value of a bundle exceeds the sum of its parts when each component has an established standalone price.

**Implementation:**
- Show the "if purchased separately" price ($40+ at $2 each) vs the bundle price ($20)
- List every module with its standalone competitor's annual price next to it
- Use the "restaurant menu" effect: seeing all 20+ modules listed makes $20 feel like a steal
- In-app: Show "You have access to X modules worth $Y if purchased individually"

### Zero-Price Effect: MyFast as the Free Hook

Free is psychologically different from cheap. Even $0.01 creates friction that $0 does not. MyFast being completely free triggers irrational preference.

**Implementation:**
- MyFast is always free, no strings attached, no upsell
- Landing page: "Start with a free fasting tracker. Stay for everything else."
- App Store: List MyFast features in the free tier description
- Users who try MyFast for free experience the quality, then the $2 for a second module feels trivial (endowment effect + foot-in-the-door)

### Scarcity: Launch Pricing Window

Create genuine scarcity around launch pricing:
- "MyLife Complete: $15 for the first 48 hours, $20 after." (launch day only)
- "Early adopter pricing locked in for the first 5,000 users."
- Do NOT use fake scarcity (countdown timers that reset, "limited" inventory that isn't). Authenticity matches the privacy-first brand.

### IKEA Effect: Module Customization

Users value things more when they've invested effort in customizing them.
- Let users choose which modules to enable (feeling of control)
- Allow reordering the dashboard (personal investment)
- Each module's first-run setup creates a small investment ("I've already set up my fasting schedule, I'm not switching now")

### Mental Accounting: "Less Than a Coffee"

Frame the $20 price in relatable mental accounts:
- "$20. Less than a single month of YNAB."
- "$20. Two coffees."
- "$20. The cost of one meal, for a lifetime of apps."
- "$2 per app. Less than a candy bar."

---

## 5. Content Marketing Plan

### Content Pillars

MyLife's content strategy is built on 5 pillars:

| Pillar | Purpose | Content Types | SEO Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| **The Subscription Tax** | Awareness: frame the problem | Calculators, cost comparisons, industry data | "app subscription cost", "how much do I spend on apps" |
| **Privacy First** | Differentiation: why offline matters | Explainers, data breach roundups, privacy guides | "privacy-first apps", "offline apps", "apps that don't track you" |
| **Module vs Competitor** | Conversion: win comparison searches | Alternative pages, vs pages, migration guides | "[Competitor] alternative", "[Competitor] vs [MyLife module]" |
| **Life Optimization** | Engagement: attract module-specific audiences | How-to guides, tips, best practices | "how to track [X]", "best [X] tips" |
| **Builder's Journey** | Community: founder transparency | Behind-the-scenes, milestone updates, technical deep-dives | Brand awareness, backlinks, community |

|------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Goodreads Alternative | "goodreads alternative" | 12,000 | API shutdown, privacy erosion |
| YNAB Alternative | "ynab alternative" | 5,400 | $109/yr price increases |

| Surfline Alternative | "surfline alternative" | 2,900 | $120/yr, near-monopoly pricing |
| MyFitnessPal Alternative | "myfitnesspal alternative" | 6,600 | 150M account breach, $200/yr |

| Quizlet Alternative | "quizlet alternative" | 8,100 | AI pivot alienating users, $96/yr |
| Day One Alternative | "day one alternative" | 1,900 | Automattic acquisition concerns |
| Notion Alternative | "notion alternative" | 9,900 | Privacy, $96/yr |
| Flo Alternative | "flo alternative" | 3,200 | Post-Dobbs privacy concerns |

Each page follows the competitor-alternatives skill framework: validate pain, position MyLife, honest comparison, migration guide, social proof from switchers, CTA.

### Comparison Calculator Tool

Build a free, interactive "App Subscription Calculator" at mylife.app/tools/subscription-cost:

- User checks off which apps they currently pay for from a list of 30+ popular apps
- Calculator shows total annual cost, 3-year cost, 5-year cost
- Compares against MyLife's $20 one-time price
- Shows savings amount with a shareable graphic
- Email capture: "Get your personalized savings report"

**Why this works:**
- Targets "how much do I spend on apps" searches
- Creates personalized, shareable content
- Moves users from awareness to decision in one tool
- Lead capture without gating the core value

Budget: $0 (build in-house, it's a simple web page with checkboxes and math)

---

## 6. Pricing Strategy Validation

### Confirmed Pricing: $2 / $5 / $20

Based on the pricing analysis, the $2/$5/$20 one-time structure is validated across multiple dimensions:

**Why $2 individual works:**
- Impulse purchase threshold (less than a coffee)
- Eliminates deliberation for "let me try one module"
- Foot-in-the-door: once a user pays $2, they are 5x more likely to upgrade
- Competitive: 55-200x cheaper than competitors' annual costs

**Why $5 five-pack works:**
- Clear discount vs 5x $2 = $10 (50% off creates "deal" psychology)
- Sweet spot for users who know they want 3-4 modules (the extra module feels free)
- Decoy effect: makes $20 complete look even more attractive

**Why $20 complete works:**
- "Just buy everything" eliminates decision fatigue
- At ~$1 per module, the per-unit price is absurdly low
- Viral shareable: "$20 for 20 apps" is a story people tell
- Compared to $820/yr in standalone apps, it's 97.6% savings in Year 1

### Optional Cloud Sync Add-on: $1-2/month

For users who want cross-device sync (Obsidian's model):
- Core app remains one-time purchase, fully functional offline
- Optional cloud sync for $1-2/month provides:
  - Cross-device sync via Supabase
  - Encrypted cloud backup
  - Web access to data
- This creates a small MRR stream without undermining the one-time core product
- Targets power users who've already demonstrated commitment

### Family Pricing: $30 one-time

- Covers up to 5 family members
- vs $100 for 5x individual Complete ($20 each)
- Creates a new price tier without subscription
- Family iCloud/Google account sharing for data

### Student Pricing: $10 one-time

- Verified via .edu email or student ID
- Captures the Quizlet/Anki demographic early
- Students become lifelong users as they age into higher-value segments

### Launch Promotional Pricing

| Promotion | Price | Duration | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| Launch Day | $15 Complete | 48 hours | Drive urgency, maximize Day 1 installs |
| Product Hunt | $15 Complete | PH day only | Convert PH traffic |
| Reddit AMA | $2 off Complete ($18) | 24 hours | Drive Reddit community adoption |
| Back to School | $8 Complete (students) | 2 weeks | Capture student market |

### When to Raise Prices

Do NOT raise prices until:
- User base exceeds 1M installs
- Module count exceeds 25
- Clear signal that pricing is "too cheap" (conversion rate >40%)
- Competitors have meaningfully caught up on value

When raising, grandfather existing purchasers. They paid once. That promise is sacred.

## 7. Referral Program Design

### Program: "Give a Module, Get a Module"

**Structure:** Double-sided, module-based rewards

**How it works:**
1. Existing MyLife user shares a unique referral link
2. Friend downloads MyLife and enters the referral code
3. Friend gets one free premium module (their choice)
4. Referrer gets one free premium module (their choice, or the next unreleased module)

**Why modules instead of money:**
- Modules cost MyLife $0 to give away (marginal cost of a software module is zero)
- Users experience more of the product, increasing likelihood of upgrading to Complete
- Each "free module" creates a new engagement hook
- "I got MyBudget for free because a friend shared MyLife" is a better story than "$2 off"

### Referral Tiers (Gamified)

| Tier | Referrals | Reward |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Starter** | 1 referral | 1 free module |
| **Advocate** | 3 referrals | MyLife 5-Pack (free) |
| **Ambassador** | 10 referrals | MyLife Complete (free) + "Ambassador" badge |
| **Founder's Circle** | 25 referrals | Lifetime access to all future modules + name in credits |

### Trigger Moments (When to Prompt)

Based on the referral-program skill's "trigger moment" framework:

| Moment | Prompt | Why It Works |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| After first "aha" (7 days active) | "You've saved $X vs standalone apps. Share MyLife?" | Savings are tangible and shareable |
| After completing first module setup | "MyBudget is set up. Know someone who'd love this?" | IKEA effect: they've invested effort |
| After enabling 3rd module | "You're using 3 modules. Give a friend their first." | Commitment & consistency |
| After 30 days active | "You've been with MyLife for a month. Help us grow?" | Established habit, high satisfaction |
| After leaving App Store review | "Thanks for the review. Share MyLife with a friend?" | Reciprocity: they just did something nice |

### Share Mechanics

1. **In-app share card** (highest conversion): Personalized graphic showing "I replaced $X/year in apps with MyLife"
2. **Unique referral link**: mylife.app/ref/[username]
3. **iMessage share**: Pre-composed message with one-tap send
4. **Social share**: Twitter/Instagram-optimized graphic

### Anti-Fraud Measures

- Referral reward only activates after the referred user has opened the app 3+ times
- Max 25 referrals per account (prevents bot abuse)
- Same device/IP detection (prevents self-referral)
- Manual review for accounts hitting 10+ referrals

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target (Month 1) | Target (Month 6) |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Referral participation rate | 5% of active users | 12% of active users |
| Referral conversion rate | 20% (referred users who install) | 30% |
| Viral coefficient (K-factor) | 0.15 | 0.35 |
| % of new users from referral | 10% | 25% |
| Cost per referred user | $0 (module cost is zero) | $0 |

## 8. Free Tool Strategy

### Primary Free Tool: App Subscription Calculator

**URL:** mylife.app/tools/subscription-cost

**What it does:** Users select which apps they currently subscribe to from a curated list of 40+ popular apps. The calculator instantly shows:
- Total monthly cost
- Total annual cost
- 3-year and 5-year projections
- How much they'd save with MyLife ($20 one-time vs their current spend)
- A shareable "savings card" graphic for social media

**Why it works (free-tool-strategy framework):**
- Solves a real problem: "How much am I actually spending on app subscriptions?"
- Adjacent to core product: leads naturally to "and you can replace all of these with MyLife"
- Simple and focused: one input (checkboxes), one output (dollar amounts)
- Worth the investment: high search volume for "app subscription calculator"

**Lead capture:** Email capture is optional, not gated. Users get full results without email. Email unlock: "Get a monthly spending alert when your tracked subscriptions increase."

**SEO value:** Targets "how much do I spend on apps", "app subscription cost calculator", "subscription spending tracker"

**Build cost:** Minimal (HTML/JS page with a list and arithmetic)

### Secondary Free Tool: Privacy Scorecard

**URL:** mylife.app/tools/privacy-check

**What it does:** Users enter or select the apps they use. The tool shows a privacy score for each app based on:
- Whether it requires an account
- Whether it stores data in the cloud
- Known data breaches
- Data sharing with third parties
- Whether an offline alternative exists

**Why it works:**
- Aligns perfectly with MyLife's privacy-first positioning
- Creates shareable, alarming results ("Your apps have a privacy score of D+")
- Natural CTA: "Replace these apps with privacy-first alternatives from MyLife"
- Generates backlinks from privacy blogs and forums

**Build cost:** Medium (requires curated database of app privacy practices)

---

## 9. Competitor Alternative Pages

### Page Architecture

Based on the competitor-alternatives skill, build four types of pages:

**Type 1: [Competitor] Alternative (singular)**
- Target: Users actively seeking to switch
- 10 pages targeting the highest-volume competitor terms
- Each page: validate pain, compare features honestly, show migration path, CTA

**Type 2: Best [Category] Apps (plural alternatives)**
- Target: Users researching category
- 8 pages covering each module's category
- Each page: criteria framework, list alternatives (MyLife first), comparison table, use-case recommendations

**Type 3: MyLife vs [Competitor]**
- Target: Users directly comparing
- 10 pages for top competitors
- Each page: TL;DR, feature-by-feature comparison, pricing comparison, who each is best for

**Type 4: [Competitor A] vs [Competitor B]**
- Target: Users comparing two competitors (not MyLife)
- 15 pages for high-volume competitor-vs-competitor searches
- Each page: compare both, introduce MyLife as "the third option"

### Priority Page List

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2): 10 highest-impact pages**

| Page | Type | Target Keyword | Priority |
|------|------|---------------|----------|
| /alternative/goodreads | Alt (singular) | "goodreads alternative" | 1 |
| /alternative/ynab | Alt (singular) | "ynab alternative" | 2 |
| /alternatives/budget-apps | Alt (plural) | "best budget apps" | 3 |
| /alternative/myfitnesspal | Alt (singular) | "myfitnesspal alternative" | 4 |
| /alternative/quizlet | Alt (singular) | "quizlet alternative" | 5 |
| /alternatives/fasting-apps | Alt (plural) | "best fasting apps" | 6 |
| /alternative/strava | Alt (singular) | "strava alternative" | 7 |
| /alternative/surfline | Alt (singular) | "surfline alternative" | 8 |
| /vs/ynab | Vs | "mylife vs ynab" | 9 |
| /alternative/calm | Alt (singular) | "calm alternative" | 10 |

**Phase 2 (Months 3-4): 15 more pages**
- /alternative/notion, /alternative/day-one, /alternative/flo, /alternative/daylio
- /alternatives/habit-apps, /alternatives/book-tracking-apps, /alternatives/workout-apps
- /vs/goodreads, /vs/surfline, /vs/strava
- /compare/ynab-vs-monarch, /compare/goodreads-vs-storygraph, /compare/strava-vs-alltrails
- /compare/calm-vs-headspace, /compare/myfitnesspal-vs-loseit

### Honesty Principle

Every comparison page must:
- Acknowledge competitor strengths genuinely
- Be accurate about MyLife's current limitations
- State who the competitor is better for (be specific)
- Never misrepresent competitor features or pricing
- Include a "Who should NOT switch to MyLife" section

This builds trust. Readers are comparing. They will verify claims. Honesty converts better than hype.

## 11. Budget Allocation

### Year 1 Budget: $50,000-75,000

This is a lean, bootstrapped budget. MyLife's greatest marketing asset is its pricing, which generates organic word-of-mouth at near-zero cost.

| Category | Monthly Budget | Annual Budget | % of Total | Key Spend |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| **App Store Ads** | $2,500-4,000 | $30,000-48,000 | 55-65% | Competitor brand terms, category terms |
| **Content/SEO** | $500-1,000 | $6,000-12,000 | 10-15% | Freelance writers for comparison pages, graphics |
| **Reddit/Community Ads** | $500-1,000 | $6,000-12,000 | 10-15% | Targeted subreddit ads |
| **Influencer Seeding** | $200-400 | $2,400-4,800 | 4-6% | Product access, small gifts |
| **Tools/Infrastructure** | $200 | $2,400 | 3-4% | Email (Resend), analytics (Plausible), hosting |
| **Podcast Sponsorships** | $300-500 | $3,600-6,000 | 5-8% | Privacy and personal finance podcasts |
| **Total** | **$4,200-7,100** | **$50,400-82,800** | **100%** | |

### Budget Rules

1. **No channel gets more than 65% of budget.** Diversification prevents platform dependency.
2. **Kill channels with >$5 CPA within 30 days.** At a $20 price point, CAC must stay under $3-4.
3. **Reinvest 50% of revenue into marketing.** Until the flywheel is spinning, revenue funds growth.
4. **$0 channels first.** Reddit, content, referrals, Product Hunt are free. Exhaust free channels before spending.

### ROI Expectations by Channel

| Channel | Expected CPA | Expected ROAS | Timeline to ROI |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Organic/word-of-mouth | $0 | Infinite | Immediate |
| Reddit (organic posts) | $0 | Infinite | 1-2 weeks |
| Product Hunt | $0 (one-time effort) | 10-50x | Launch day |
| Referral program | $0 (module cost is zero) | Infinite | 1-3 months |
| Content/SEO | $0.50-2.00 | 5-20x | 3-6 months |
| App Store search ads | $1-3 | 3-10x | Immediate |
| Reddit ads | $2-5 | 2-5x | 1-2 weeks |
| Podcast sponsorships | $3-8 | 1.5-3x | 2-4 weeks |

## Appendix C: Messaging Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Lead with the savings number ($820 vs $20)
- Use "one-time purchase" and "buy once, use forever"
- Say "your data stays on your device" not "we don't collect data" (positive framing)
- Name specific competitors and their prices (factual comparison is legal and persuasive)
- Use "the app subscription tax" phrase consistently
- Show the math: let users calculate their own savings
- Frame privacy as empowerment, not fear ("Own your data" not "They're watching you")

### Don't

- Use subscription language ("only $X/month") -- this undermines the one-time purchase message
- Claim to be "better" than every competitor at everything (Pratfall Effect: acknowledge limitations)
- Use fake urgency or scarcity (conflicts with privacy-first trust brand)
- Trash competitors' products (criticize their pricing and data practices, respect their features)
- Promise features that aren't built yet without clearly marking them as "coming soon"
- Use emojis in marketing copy (per brand guidelines)
- Use em dashes in documents or writing (per brand guidelines)
