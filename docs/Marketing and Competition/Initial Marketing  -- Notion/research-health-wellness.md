# Health & Wellness App Market Research

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Scope:** Market analysis for 5 MyLife health & wellness modules: MyFast, MyHabits, MyMeds, MyMood, MyCycle

## Executive Summary

The health & wellness app categories targeted by MyLife represent a combined addressable market exceeding **$50 billion** (2025 estimates across all 5 categories). The most mature and lucrative category is **cycle tracking/femtech** ($39-46B broad femtech market), followed by **mental health/mood tracking** ($7-10B), **habit tracking** ($1.7-13B depending on scope), **medication management** ($3.5-4.2B), and **intermittent fasting** ($300M-1.2B).

Key findings:
- **Flo Health** dominates femtech with 380M+ downloads, $200M+ gross bookings (2024), and a $1B+ valuation
- **Simple** (fasting) hit $100M revenue in 2024 with 20M+ downloads and 700K paying subscribers
- **Zero** (fasting) has 10M+ users but generates only ~$200K/month, signaling commoditization at the free tier
- **Daylio** (mood) leads its category with 18M+ downloads as a bootstrapped company
- **Medisafe** (meds) raised $51.5M total with dual B2C/B2B pharma revenue model
- Privacy-first, offline-first positioning (MyLife's approach) is a genuine differentiator -- most competitors rely on cloud accounts and data monetization

## 1. Intermittent Fasting Apps (MyFast)

### Market Size
- **TAM:** $300M-$1.2B (2024), growing at 8-24% CAGR depending on source
- Forecasts range from $454M to $7.6B by 2031-2033
- The wide range reflects different scopes: pure fasting trackers vs. broader fasting-adjacent wellness

### Key Competitors

#### Zero (Big Sky Health)
- **Users:** 10M+ registered globally, 500K+ five-star ratings
- **Downloads:** ~40K/month (Jan 2026, Sensor Tower)
- **Revenue:** ~$200K/month (~$2.4M/yr) from subscriptions
- **Pricing:** Free tier + Zero Plus at $69.99/yr
- **Funding:** $8M Series A (2020) from Greycroft, Obvious Ventures, Kresge Foundation
- **Notes:** Rebranded to "Zero Longevity Science," expanded beyond fasting into longevity content. Growth appears to have plateaued after pandemic-era boom (500% user increase from 2019-2021)

#### Simple (Simple Life Apps)
- **Users:** 20M+ downloads, 800K active subscribers, 700K paying
- **Revenue:** $100M in 2024 (64% YoY growth), operating profitable. $160M ARR reported
- **Pricing:** Ranges from ~$30-60/yr depending on plan
- **Funding:** $45M total -- $10M Series A, $35M Series B (Oct 2025, led by Kevin Hart's Hartbeat Ventures)
- **Valuation:** $42M (2025 reported)
- **Notes:** Pivoted from pure fasting to AI health coaching ("Avo" coach). Won MedTech Breakthrough's 2025 "Best Virtual Health Coach." 19M coaching messages in January 2025 alone. Cyprus-based, founded 2015

#### Fastic
- **Users:** 12.3M registered (2024)
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed; 15% of monthly CRM revenue from intro offers, 35% "Welcome Back" conversion rate
- **Pricing:** Freemium with premium subscription
- **Funding:** $5M Seed (2020) from BLN Capital, Monkfish Equity
- **Notes:** Berlin-based. Adopted MoEngage for customer engagement (2024). Growth slower than Simple

#### BodyFast
- **Users:** 50M+ installs (self-reported as "#1 fasting app by installs")
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed
- **Pricing:** Free tier + Coach plan (premium)
- **Notes:** German-based. High install volume but unclear on monetization and active user retention

#### Life Fasting (LifeOmic)
- **Users:** 1M+ total downloads before shutdown
- **Status:** Shut down / deprecated. Was backed by LifeOmic's precision health platform
- **Notes:** Featured social "LIFE Circles" communities. Demonstrates market attrition risk

#### FastHabit & Window
- Niche players with minimal public data. FastHabit focuses on Apple Watch integration. Window emphasizes clean UI
- Neither has disclosed user counts or revenue

### Category Insights
- **Winner-take-most dynamics:** Simple has broken away with $100M+ revenue by evolving into an AI health coach, not just a timer. Pure timer apps (Zero, BodyFast) struggle to monetize
- **ARPU:** Simple achieves ~$143/paid subscriber/yr vs. Zero at ~$70/yr
- **Commoditization risk:** A fasting timer is trivially simple to build. Differentiation comes from content, coaching, community, or integration with broader health tracking
- **MyFast opportunity:** Privacy-first, offline-first fasting timer bundled in a suite is a strong free-tier hook (no subscription needed for basic timing). The standalone fasting timer market is commoditized, but as a module within MyLife it drives engagement without needing to compete on AI coaching

---

## 2. Habit Tracking Apps (MyHabits)

### Market Size
- **TAM:** $1.7B (2024, narrow definition) to $13B (2025, broad definition including productivity)
- US market projected at $676.8M by 2035 (5.91% CAGR)
- Projected to reach $2.1B by 2031 or $50.2B by 2035 depending on scope
- iOS users account for 55% of total market share

### Key Competitors

#### Streaks (Crunchy Bagel)
- **Platform:** iOS/macOS only (Apple ecosystem exclusive)
- **Users:** Undisclosed, but won Apple Design Award (multiple times)
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed; bootstrapped indie developer
- **Pricing:** $4.99 one-time purchase (no subscription)
- **Notes:** Deep Apple integration (Apple Watch, Siri Shortcuts, Health app, Vision Pro). Premium positioning through design quality. The one-time purchase model is increasingly rare and loved by users. Interaction time rose 41% after Vision Pro integration (2024)

#### Habitica (HabitRPG)
- **Users:** 4M+ registered users
- **Revenue:** ~$420K/yr estimated (bootstrapped, profitable)
- **Pricing:** Free tier + $47.88/yr subscription + in-app gem purchases
- **Funding:** Kickstarter origin (2013, $25K goal) + Backstage Capital investment
- **Notes:** Gamification RPG model is unique in the category. Social guilds and challenges drive retention. Community-driven features in mid-2023 boosted retention 39% and social engagement 51%

#### Productive (Apalon / IAC)
- **Users:** Undisclosed
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed (backed by IAC, a public company)
- **Pricing:** Free tier + ~$39.99/yr premium
- **Notes:** AI-powered habit suggestions (2023) drove 28% engagement increase and 34% streak completion improvement. Part of IAC's app portfolio (large corporate backing)

#### Habitify
- **Users:** 1M+ users
- **Revenue:** ~$21K/month (~$252K/yr)
- **Pricing:** Free / $4.99/mo / $29.99/yr / lifetime options
- **Funding:** Unfunded (bootstrapped from Vietnam)
- **Notes:** Cross-platform (iOS, Android, Mac, wearables). Real-time sync launch in early 2024 improved sync efficiency 46% and wearable habit completion 37%

#### HabitBull
- **Users:** Undisclosed (smaller player)
- **Pricing:** Free / Premium
- **Notes:** Available on both platforms but has lost mindshare to newer competitors

#### Loop Habit Tracker
- **Users:** Undisclosed but popular on F-Droid and Google Play
- **Revenue:** $0 (completely free and open source)
- **Pricing:** Free, no ads, no IAP
- **Notes:** Privacy-focused, open-source. Appeals to the exact demographic MyLife targets. Android only

#### Strides
- **Users:** Undisclosed
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed
- **Pricing:** Free / $4.99/mo to $79.99 lifetime
- **Notes:** iOS-only. Focuses on SMART goal setting alongside habit tracking

### Category Insights
- **Fragmented market:** No dominant player with >10M users. The category is split between indie developers (Streaks, Habitify, Loop) and corporate-backed apps (Productive/IAC)
- **Low ARPU:** Most successful apps charge $30-50/yr. One-time purchases (Streaks at $4.99) are beloved but limit revenue
- **Differentiation strategies:** Gamification (Habitica), design excellence (Streaks), AI suggestions (Productive), cross-platform sync (Habitify)
- **MyHabits opportunity:** The market is ripe for a privacy-first, offline-first habit tracker. Loop Habit Tracker proves demand for this positioning but is Android-only. MyHabits as a cross-platform, privacy-first module fills a genuine gap. Bundle value within MyLife Pro makes the subscription more palatable than standalone $40/yr habit apps

---

## 3. Medication Tracking Apps (MyMeds)

### Market Size
- **TAM (US):** $3.5B (2024), projected to $10.2B by 2030 (12.8% CAGR)
- **Global:** $1.5-4.2B (2024 estimates) growing to $12.4B by 2032 (11.84% CAGR)
- North America dominates the market due to complex medication regimens and aging population
- Healthcare compliance is a $100B+ problem: medication non-adherence costs the US healthcare system $100-300B annually

### Key Competitors

#### Medisafe
- **Users:** 5M+ registered, 2B+ medication doses recorded
- **Revenue:** Dual model -- B2C freemium + B2B pharma partnerships (data insights, targeted patient engagement)
- **Funding:** $51.5M total ($30M Series C in Feb 2021 led by Sanofi Ventures)
- **Impact data:** $6,280 average annual cost reduction per MS patient, 63% decrease in ER visits; $4,600 savings per epilepsy patient, 36% ER reduction
- **Notes:** Market leader. Predictive AI for adherence. Expanded pharma partnerships in 2024. Revenue from pharma companies paying for patient engagement is the primary business model

#### MyTherapy (smartpatient GmbH)
- **Users:** Hundreds of thousands (estimated)
- **Revenue:** B2B pharma model (free to consumers)
- **Pricing:** Free (no premium tier)
- **Notes:** German-based. Won first place in German Health Award (2023). Includes health journal, activity tracking, and provider sharing. Strong in European markets

#### Dosecast
- **Users:** 1M+ downloads
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed
- **Pricing:** Free / Premium
- **Notes:** Launched 2010. Highly customizable notification system. Niche but loyal user base

#### Mango Health
- **Status:** Acquired by TrialCard (now part of digital patient engagement platform)
- **Revenue:** B2B pharma
- **Notes:** Pioneered gamification in medication adherence. Post-acquisition, focused on pharma partner integrations

#### CareZone
- **Status:** Acquired by Walmart Health
- **Revenue:** B2B (Walmart ecosystem)
- **Notes:** AI-powered medication management. Now integrated into Walmart's healthcare strategy

### Category Insights
- **B2B pharma is the real money:** Direct-to-consumer medication apps are hard to monetize (users resist paying for pill reminders). The profitable players (Medisafe, MyTherapy, Mango Health) all monetize through pharma partnerships and data insights
- **Consolidation trend:** CareZone (Walmart), Mango Health (TrialCard) -- smaller players are being acquired by healthcare platforms
- **Regulation tailwind:** FDA digital therapeutics approvals and CMS medication adherence incentives are driving institutional adoption
- **MyMeds opportunity:** Privacy-first positioning is a major differentiator here. Competing apps share medication data with pharma companies (their primary revenue source). MyMeds with zero data sharing, offline storage, and no accounts could attract the privacy-conscious segment. As a module in a $4.99/mo suite rather than a standalone monetization challenge, it doesn't need to solve the B2B pharma problem

---

## 4. Mood Tracking Apps (MyMood)

### Market Size
- **Broader mental health app TAM:** $7.4-8.2B (2024), projected to $17.5-22.7B by 2030-2033 (9.5-18% CAGR)
- North America: 36.4% revenue share (2024)
- iOS: 48.3% platform share (2024)
- Mood tracking is a subset of the broader mental health app market (which includes therapy platforms like BetterHelp/Talkspace, meditation apps like Calm/Headspace)

### Key Competitors

#### Daylio
- **Users:** 18M+ total downloads
- **Downloads:** ~160K/month combined (100K Android, 60K iOS -- Jan 2026)
- **Revenue:** ~$150K/month combined ($100K iOS, $50K Android) = ~$1.8M/yr
- **Pricing:** Free tier + $4.99/mo or $35.99/yr premium
- **Funding:** Bootstrapped (Bratislava, Slovakia, founded 2015 by Samuel Bednar)
- **Notes:** Category leader in pure mood tracking. "Micro-diary" approach (no text required, just tap emotions and activities). 4.8-star ratings on both platforms. iOS generates 2x the revenue of Android despite fewer downloads, indicating higher conversion/willingness to pay on iOS

#### Pixels (Year in Pixels)
- **Users:** 1M+ downloads (Android)
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed
- **Pricing:** Free / Premium
- **Notes:** Visual "pixel per day" grid approach. Simple and appealing visual design. Smaller player

#### MindDoc (formerly MoodPath)
- **Users:** Undisclosed
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed
- **Pricing:** Free / Premium subscription
- **Notes:** CBT-based (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) mood support. Backed by Schoen Clinic (German healthcare provider). Strong Android traction. More clinical positioning than pure mood tracking

#### Bearable
- **Users:** Undisclosed
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed
- **Pricing:** Free / Premium
- **Notes:** Positions as a comprehensive health tracker (mood, symptoms, medications, activities). Strong community on Reddit. Appeals to chronic illness community. More complex than pure mood trackers

#### How We Feel
- **Users:** Undisclosed
- **Revenue:** Non-profit model (no revenue target)
- **Pricing:** Free
- **Notes:** Founded by the How We Feel Project (non-profit). AI-powered weekly emotional review. High-quality design. Not a commercial competitor but sets user expectations for free, well-designed mood tracking

### Category Insights
- **Low monetization ceiling:** Daylio, the category leader, generates only ~$1.8M/yr from 18M downloads. Mood tracking alone is hard to monetize -- users expect it to be free or very cheap
- **Clinical crossover:** Apps that bridge mood tracking into clinical utility (MindDoc, Bearable) have better monetization potential through healthcare partnerships
- **Non-profit competition:** How We Feel offers high-quality free mood tracking, putting price pressure on the category
- **MyMood opportunity:** As a module within MyLife Pro, mood tracking doesn't need to justify standalone subscription pricing. Cross-module insights (mood correlated with fasting, exercise, sleep, habits) are the unique value proposition no standalone mood app can offer. The integrated data story is MyLife's moat

---

## 5. Cycle Tracking Apps (MyCycle)

### Market Size
- **FemTech TAM:** $38.6-45.6B (2024-2025), projected to $82.9-140.6B by 2030-2035 (13.9-14.4% CAGR)
- **Menstrual health apps specifically:** $1.69B (2024), projected to $5.07B by 2030
- This is the largest and most well-funded category of the five researched

### Key Competitors

#### Flo Health
- **Users:** 380M+ downloads, 70M MAU, ~5M paid subscribers
- **Revenue:** $200M+ gross bookings (2024), up from $112M in 2023 and $35M in 2022 (471% growth in 2 years). ~$8.8M/month in-app revenue (July 2024, top-grossing period tracker globally)
- **Pricing:** Free tier + $49.99/yr or $9.99/mo premium
- **Funding:** $275M+ total. $200M Series C (July 2024) from General Atlantic
- **Valuation:** $1B+ (first purely digital consumer women's health unicorn)
- **Notes:** London-based. Dominant market leader by every metric. AI-powered health insights, pregnancy and postpartum tracking. 50% YoY revenue growth in 2024

#### Clue (BioWink)
- **Users:** 100M+ total users, 10M MAU, across 190 countries
- **Revenue:** ~$1M/month (recent Sensor Tower est.), ~$600K/month (July 2024 Statista)
- **Pricing:** Free tier + Clue Plus subscription
- **Funding:** $56M total over 9 rounds. Major Verdane investment in Jan 2026 (from EUR 2B growth fund)
- **Notes:** Berlin-based. Science-forward positioning. On path to sustainable profitability (2025). Research partnerships with universities. Privacy-focused (European data regulations). Strong in European markets

#### Natural Cycles
- **Users:** 4-5M registered
- **Revenue:** Targeting $100M for 2025 (EBITDA margin >25%)
- **Pricing:** $99.99/yr or $12.99/mo
- **Funding:** $95M+ total ($55M Series C, May 2024)
- **Notes:** Swiss-Swedish. FDA-cleared as contraceptive (the first and only FDA-cleared birth control app). Health Canada approval Jan 2024. Apple Watch Series 8 temperature sensor integration (Jan 2024). Founders planning new funding round ahead of potential IPO. Unique regulatory moat as certified medical device

#### Ovia Health
- **Users:** 15M users
- **Revenue:** B2B employer health model (offered as employee benefit)
- **Pricing:** Free to users (employers pay)
- **Notes:** Launched Postpartum Experience feature Dec 2024 (12-month program). Not a direct competitor in consumer market since it's employer-sponsored. Partnered with Sentara Health Plans

#### Period Tracker (GP Apps)
- **Users:** 10M+ Android installs, ~40K downloads/month
- **Revenue:** ~$10-15K/month estimated
- **Pricing:** Free / minimal premium
- **Notes:** Long-tenured (launched early). Privacy concerns flagged by Privacy International. Declining competitiveness against Flo/Clue

#### Glow
- **Users:** Undisclosed (previously reported several million)
- **Revenue:** Undisclosed
- **Notes:** Glow offers fertility, pregnancy, baby, and parenting tracking. Broader family planning scope. Has faced privacy controversies

### Category Insights
- **Power law distribution:** Flo Health captures the vast majority of revenue ($200M+) while competitors fight over scraps. Clue at ~$12M/yr is a distant second
- **Premium pricing works:** Natural Cycles charges $99.99/yr (2x Flo) by positioning as FDA-cleared contraception, not just a tracker
- **Regulatory moat:** Natural Cycles' FDA clearance as a contraceptive device creates a category of one. This is not replicable without significant clinical trials investment
- **Privacy is a selling point:** Post-Dobbs (2022 Roe v. Wade reversal), cycle tracking privacy became a mainstream concern. Clue explicitly markets its European data hosting. This trend directly benefits MyLife's privacy-first approach
- **MyCycle opportunity:** Privacy-first, offline-only cycle tracking with zero cloud storage is a genuine market differentiator in the post-Dobbs era. No other major competitor offers truly offline-only cycle tracking. MyLife's SQLite-only architecture means cycle data never leaves the device, which is a powerful marketing message. The challenge is feature parity with Flo's AI predictions and content library

## Key Takeaways for MyLife

### 1. Privacy Is the Moat
Across all 5 categories, privacy concerns are rising. Post-Dobbs cycle tracking privacy, pharma data sharing in medication apps, mental health data sensitivity -- MyLife's offline-first, zero-telemetry architecture is a genuine competitive advantage, not just a feature checkbox. This should be the lead marketing message.

### 2. Bundle Economics Beat Standalone
The most successful standalone health apps charge $30-100/yr. MyLife Pro at $4.99/mo ($59.88/yr) for 10+ modules offers dramatically better value than any single competitor. A user paying $50/yr for Flo + $36/yr for Daylio + $70/yr for Zero is spending $156/yr. MyLife replaces all three for $60/yr.

### 3. Cross-Module Insights Are Unique
No standalone app can correlate fasting with mood, habits with cycle data, or medication timing with energy levels. This integrated data story is what justifies the suite subscription and creates retention that no single-purpose app can match.

### 4. Free Tier Strategy (MyFast) Is Validated
Simple proved that fasting is a massive funnel ($100M revenue). Zero proved that a free fasting timer attracts 10M+ users. Offering MyFast as the free module is strategically sound -- it's the lowest-barrier entry point with the largest potential user pool.

### 5. Category-Specific Positioning

| Module | Competitive Position | Key Differentiator |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **MyFast** | Commoditized timer space, but free tier entry | Always free, no upsell, privacy-first |
| **MyHabits** | Fragmented market, no dominant player | Cross-platform + offline (Loop is Android-only, Streaks is iOS-only) |
| **MyMeds** | Hard to monetize standalone (B2B pharma wins) | Privacy-first (competitors share data with pharma) |
| **MyMood** | Low monetization ceiling standalone | Cross-module correlations (mood + fasting + habits) |
| **MyCycle** | Dominated by Flo, but privacy demand is real | Truly offline cycle data (post-Dobbs differentiator) |

### 6. Risks and Challenges
- **Feature gap with incumbents:** Flo has AI predictions, Natural Cycles has FDA clearance, Simple has an AI coach. MyLife modules will initially be simpler
- **Discovery problem:** Users search for "fasting app" or "period tracker," not "privacy-first health suite." ASO and marketing must bridge this gap
- **Retention:** Standalone apps struggle with retention (30-day retention for health apps averages 10-15%). The suite model must prove that cross-module stickiness improves this metric

### 7. Revenue Benchmarks for Modeling
- Conservative ARPU for health/wellness subscriptions: $30-60/yr
- MyLife Pro at $59.88/yr is competitively priced
- Lifetime option at $79.99 is aggressively priced compared to competitors ($99-$300 lifetime tiers common)
- If MyLife captures just 0.01% of the combined ~$55B TAM, that represents $5.5M ARR
