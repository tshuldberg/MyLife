## Key Competitive Insights

### Fasting App Patterns
1. **AI is the differentiator.** Simple (Coach Avo) and Fastic (Fasty + Food Scanner) lead with AI-powered coaching and food recognition. Zero and BodyFast rely on algorithmic/expert approaches.
2. **Food photo scanning is table stakes.** Simple, Zero, and Fastic all offer snap-a-photo food logging. BodyFast is behind here.
3. **Longevity vs weight loss positioning.** Zero positions around longevity science (Peter Attia, circadian biology). Simple, Fastic, and BodyFast lead with weight loss.
4. **Social is weak across the category.** No app has strong community features. Fastic's Buddies and BodyFast's challenges are lightweight.
5. **Pricing clusters around $60-80/year.** BodyFast is the most expensive at ~$120-180/year for the Coach.

### Habit Tracking App Patterns
1. **Gamification depth is the wedge.** Habitica is in a category of its own with full RPG mechanics. Others use lightweight streaks and challenges.
2. **Apple ecosystem dominance.** Streaks and Productive are Apple-only. Habitify is the most cross-platform. Habitica is iOS/Android/Web.
3. **One-time purchase vs subscription.** Streaks at $4.99 one-time is remarkably positioned against $30-90/year subscriptions.
4. **Health integration varies widely.** Streaks and Habitify offer deep Apple Health integration with auto-completion. Habitica and Productive have no health sync.
5. **No AI in any habit tracker.** None of the four apps use AI coaching, suggestions, or insights. This is an open opportunity.
6. **Social accountability differs by approach.** Habitica uses RPG party damage mechanics. Habitify uses competitive challenges. Streaks uses simple sharing. Productive uses community challenges.
