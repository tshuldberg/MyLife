# Timeline

## 2026-02-27

- Consolidated MySubs into MyBudget: retired the standalone MySubs module from the MyLife hub.
- Enhanced MyBudget's 200+ entry subscription catalog with cancellation URLs, difficulty ratings (easy/medium/hard/impossible), and step-by-step cancellation notes, sourced from JustDeleteMe's open-source database (MIT).
- Added bank-detected subscription discovery: a pure recurring charge detector that analyzes Plaid transaction data to auto-discover subscriptions. Includes payee normalization, frequency detection (weekly/monthly/annual), catalog fuzzy matching, confidence scoring, and dismissed-payee filtering.
- Removed `@mylife/subs` module from module-registry types/constants, mobile app (_layout, DatabaseProvider, use-module-toggle, discover), web app (modules, db, Providers, Sidebar, next.config, tests), and deleted `modules/subs/` source and `apps/*/app/(subs)/` + `apps/web/app/subs/` routes.
- Updated parity matrix: MySubs changed from `design_only` with moduleId `'subs'` to `standalone_only` with moduleId `null` (no hub integration).
- Free tier updated: only MyFast remains free (MySubs subscription tracking now lives within MyBudget premium module).
- Updated CLAUDE.md (module count 11 to 10, removed Subs table prefix, updated free tier description, removed subs from architecture diagram) and AGENTS.md (synced).
- Updated MyBudget CLAUDE.md with new catalog and bank-detection feature documentation.
- Verification: parity checks pass (`pnpm check:parity`), no orphaned subs references in codebase.

## 2026-02-24

- Identified and completed the highest-priority start step: restore monorepo typecheck health before new feature work.
- Updated `@mylife/ui` button/text compatibility to match existing mobile usage (`label` prop support, `ghost` variant, `bookAuthor` typography variant).
- Fixed Expo SQLite adapter typing in mobile database provider.
- Added React provider type bridges in mobile and web app providers to avoid cross-package React type conflicts.
- Updated web books/subscriptions flows to align with current module contracts and enum values.
- Added app-level TypeScript overrides for web (`composite/declaration` disabled) to avoid TS2742 portability errors in app routes.
- Verification: `pnpm typecheck` now passes across all 23 workspace packages.
- Began Phase 2 implementation in `@mylife/budget` with a full module scaffold:
  module definition + migration, SQLite schema, core Zod types, and CRUD operations.
- Added workspace peer dependency wiring for budget module and re-linked workspace with `pnpm install`.
- Verification: `pnpm -C modules/budget typecheck` and root `pnpm typecheck` pass after scaffold.

- Verification:
  - `pnpm -C apps/mobile -s typecheck` passes.
  - `pnpm -C modules/budget -s typecheck` passes.
  - `pnpm -C apps/web -s typecheck` currently fails due unrelated pre-existing `apps/web/app/recipes/page.tsx` type mismatch (`is_favorite` number vs boolean); no Budget file type errors were surfaced.
  - Root `pnpm -s typecheck` fails for the same unrelated web recipes typecheck error.
- Built next budget steps focused on transaction management parity:
  - Web transactions now support inline edit/save/cancel and client-side filters (direction/account/envelope) in `apps/web/app/budget/page.tsx`.
  - Added mobile transaction detail/edit/delete route at `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/transaction/[id].tsx`.
  - Wired mobile transactions list rows to open transaction detail from `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/transactions.tsx`.
  - Registered transaction detail route in `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/_layout.tsx`.
- Verification:
  - `pnpm -C apps/mobile -s typecheck`, `pnpm -C apps/web -s typecheck`, and `pnpm -C modules/budget -s typecheck` are currently blocked by unrelated `packages/db/src/index.ts` export errors (missing friend query exports from `hub-queries`).
- Resolved the `@mylife/db` export mismatch that was blocking all downstream typechecks:
  - Removed stale friend-message re-exports from `packages/db/src/index.ts` that were not implemented in `hub-queries.ts`.

    - `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/goal/create.tsx`
    - `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/goal/[id].tsx`
  - Wired goals navigation from budget home and route registration in `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/index.tsx` and `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/_layout.tsx`.
- Exported missing goal APIs/types from `@mylife/budget` so app layers can consume them:

  - `pnpm -C apps/web -s typecheck` passes.
  - `pnpm -C apps/mobile -s typecheck` passes.
  - `pnpm -s typecheck` passes.
- Re-review (2026-02-25 earlier export-mismatch blocker): package API export gaps can look like app regressions; keeping `modules/budget/src/index.ts` aligned with implemented CRUD APIs prevented repeated downstream typecheck failures.
- Skill opportunity: create a reusable “module parity slice” skill for web+mobile rollout steps (actions, routes/screens, validation, timeline logging) to reduce repeated setup work.
- Continued dual-model execution for DM-039/DM-040 and identity hardening across web/mobile/self-host:
  - Added mode-aware sync adapters and proxy pathing:

    - updated friends/share APIs and web books actions/UI to prefer token-based identity with compatible fallback behavior.
  - Brought self-host API behavior to contract parity for invite/friend/share flows:
    - updated `deploy/self-host/api/src/server.js`, `deploy/self-host/scripts/migrate.sh`, and `docs/self-host/api-contract.yaml` (version `0.3.0`).
- Verification:
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/db test` passes (48 tests).
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile typecheck` and `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test` pass (24 tests).

    - Required resolved actor identity on web invite mutation routes:
      - `apps/web/app/api/friends/invites/[inviteId]/accept/route.ts`
      - `apps/web/app/api/friends/invites/[inviteId]/decline/route.ts`
      - `apps/web/app/api/friends/invites/[inviteId]/revoke/route.ts`

      - `apps/mobile/lib/friend-messages.ts`
    - Added self-host actor token issuance + verification + strict-mode enforcement:
      - `deploy/self-host/api/src/server.js`
      - new endpoint: `POST /api/identity/actor/issue`
      - social/message routes now resolve identity from token first with controlled legacy fallback.
    - Added rollout and incident runbook:
      - `docs/self-host/actor-identity-operations.md`
      - updated `deploy/self-host/.env.example`, `docs/self-host/README.md`, and `docs/self-host/troubleshooting.md`.

  - Note: full `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test` currently includes unrelated pre-existing failures in sidebar/subs/recipes suites; new DM-051/052/053 tests pass.
- Added full self-host connection-method onboarding UX for decentralized reachability across web + mobile:
  - Implemented selectable setup methods with explicit user-facing tradeoffs in both UIs:
    - `Port Forwarding + Domain + TLS`
    - `Dynamic DNS + Port Forwarding`
    - `Outbound Tunnel (no inbound port)`
  - Added per-method overview, `Best for`, `Pros`, and `Cons` plus guided step-by-step setup flows and suggested URL autofill.
  - Persisted selected method through preferences:
    - web actions in `apps/web/app/actions.ts`
    - mobile direct preference storage in `apps/mobile/app/(hub)/self-host.tsx`.
  - Added detailed user/operator docs and implementation plan:
    - `docs/self-host/connection-method-guides.md`
    - `docs/self-host/connection-method-ui-plan.md`
    - linked from `docs/self-host/README.md`.
- Stabilized and validated connection-method tests:
  - Fixed ambiguous RN test assertion in `apps/mobile/app/(hub)/__tests__/self-host.test.tsx` (`getByText` to `getAllByText` for repeated labels).
  - Verification:
    - `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test -- --run "app/(hub)/__tests__/self-host.test.tsx"` passes (4 tests).
    - `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run app/__tests__/self-host-page.test.tsx` passes (4 tests).
    - `pnpm --filter @mylife/web typecheck` passes.
    - `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile typecheck` passes.
- Expanded self-host wizard test coverage to full user-flow expectations across web + mobile:
  - Added web self-host flow cases in `apps/web/app/__tests__/self-host-page.test.tsx`:
    - persisted method restore visibility,
    - step reset on method switch,
    - method-specific suggested URL behavior,
    - step navigation boundary clamping (first/last step).
  - Added mobile self-host flow cases in `apps/mobile/app/(hub)/__tests__/self-host.test.tsx`:
    - persisted method initialization,
    - method-specific suggested URL behavior,
    - step boundary and switch-reset behavior,
    - failed connection path assertion (no setup completion event on fail).
- Verification (full suites):
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test` passes (133 tests).
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test` passes (36 tests).
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/web typecheck` passes.
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile typecheck` passes.
- Completed full behavior-first test sweep hardening for hub + MyBooks + local module pages, then resolved all discovered e2e/test-harness issues:
  - Stabilized Playwright behavior tests with user-visible, section-scoped selectors and deterministic flow assertions:
    - `apps/web/e2e/books-user-flows.spec.ts`
    - `apps/web/e2e/budget-user-flows.spec.ts`
    - `apps/web/e2e/hub-and-settings.spec.ts`
    - `apps/web/e2e/local-module-crud.spec.ts`
  - Updated self-host e2e coverage to current wizard UX and made connection testing deterministic by waiting for loaded URL state before mutation.
  - Ensured monorepo root `pnpm test` no longer fails in no-test packages by enabling `--passWithNoTests` where appropriate:
    - `modules/surf/package.json`
    - `modules/workouts/package.json`
    - `modules/homes/package.json`
    - `packages/migration/package.json`
- Validation:
  - `pnpm test` (turbo workspace suite) passes.
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test` passes (36 tests).
  - `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test` passes (133 tests).
  - Playwright e2e specs pass when run per-spec:
    - `e2e/api-auth-and-pipeline.spec.ts`
    - `e2e/books-user-flows.spec.ts`
    - `e2e/budget-user-flows.spec.ts`
    - `e2e/hub-and-settings.spec.ts`
    - `e2e/local-module-crud.spec.ts`
  - Note: in this shell environment, long aggregated Playwright invocations were intermittently terminated (SIGTERM) by the runner; per-spec execution consistently passes and exercises the same full e2e coverage.

### Entry 2026-02-25.1 — Behavior-First Budget Test Suite Expansion
**Phase:** Testing and QA hardening
**What happened:** Added full behavior-first Budget coverage across web and mobile (buttons, routes, create/edit/delete flows, goal filter/sort UX, transaction filters, and e2e pipeline assertions). Stabilized flaky e2e selectors in budget and local module suites, and added a full-suite runner script that executes DB/module/app tests plus per-spec Playwright runs with deterministic process cleanup.
**Decision:** Kept Playwright validation split by spec and hardened selector strategy (exact/section-scoped) to reduce false failures from ambiguous text matches and dev-server reuse drift; this prioritizes user-behavior verification reliability over one-shot monolithic e2e execution in this shell.
**Files created/modified:** 9+ files, including:
- `apps/web/app/budget/page.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/goals.tsx`
- `apps/web/app/budget/__tests__/budget-page.test.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/__tests__/goals.test.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/app/(budget)/__tests__/goal-forms.test.tsx`
- `apps/web/e2e/budget-user-flows.spec.ts`
- `apps/web/e2e/local-module-crud.spec.ts`
- `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`
- `scripts/dev/run-full-behavior-suite.sh`

#### Confusion Point 1 (re-review of 2026-02-25 Playwright runner instability): aggregated e2e reliability
**Updated finding:** The original conclusion still holds for single monolithic Playwright runs, but the mitigation now proved effective: per-spec execution with explicit cleanup (`run-full-behavior-suite.sh`) completed successfully end-to-end and is now the preferred operational path.

**Skill opportunity:** Add a dedicated `playwright-suite-orchestrator` skill that enforces pre/post process cleanup, per-spec retries with crash diagnostics, and standardized e2e run summaries.

### Entry 2026-02-25.2 — Turbopack Import Resolution + Full Coverage Gates
**Phase:** Build reliability + test hardening
**What happened:** Fixed Turbopack module-resolution regressions caused by local `*.js` import suffixes in TS source, then added hard 100% coverage enforcement for the affected shared packages.
- Updated internal imports in `@mylife/module-registry` and `@mylife/entitlements` to extensionless relative paths (`./foo`), including barrel exports and tests.
- Added/expanded tests for module-registry runtime surfaces:
  - hooks behavior (`useModuleRegistry`, `useEnabledModules`, `useModule`)
  - schema validation branches in `types.ts`
  - barrel re-export integrity in `index.ts`
  - invalid registration rejection path in registry tests
- Added strict coverage configs and scripts in both packages (100% lines/statements/functions/branches).
- Expanded entitlements branch tests (invalid payload verification, invalid expiry timestamp, missing update-pack year, expired update-pack denial, non-matching revoke list, missing WebCrypto, single-byte signature buffer path).
**Decision:** Enforce full coverage directly in package `test` scripts so regressions fail immediately in normal package test runs rather than relying on optional coverage passes.
**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/module-registry test` -> 100% coverage across all tracked files.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/module-registry typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/entitlements test` -> 100% coverage across tracked runtime files (`types.ts` excluded as type-only).
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/entitlements typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm dev` restarted successfully; web route on `http://localhost:3000` responds `200` after compile.

### Entry 2026-02-25.3 — Web Module Bootstrap Wiring (MyBooks -> Full Web Suite)
**Phase:** Hub module activation + onboarding defaults
**What happened:** Wired the web app to auto-enable all currently supported migrated modules for fresh and legacy DB states that only had MyBooks enabled.
- Added one-time bootstrap logic in `apps/web/app/actions.ts#getEnabledModuleIds`:
  - if `hub_enabled_modules` is empty, or legacy state is `['books']`, enable all `WEB_SUPPORTED_MODULE_IDS`,
  - run module migrations for each enabled module,
  - persist bootstrap completion in `hub_preferences` key `web.bootstrap.enabled_modules.v1`.
- Added focused test coverage for bootstrap behavior:
  - `apps/web/app/__tests__/actions-enabled-modules.test.ts`.
**Decision:** Use a one-time guarded bootstrap (preference-flagged) instead of forcing all modules every request, preserving user-controlled enable/disable state after initial migration.
**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run app/__tests__/actions-enabled-modules.test.ts` -> pass (4 tests).
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run app/__tests__/hub-dashboard.test.tsx app/__tests__/discover-page.test.tsx` -> pass (5 tests).
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web typecheck` -> pass.
- Runtime DB check after hitting `/`:
  - `hub_enabled_modules` now contains `books,budget,car,fast,habits,meds,recipes,subs`.

### Entry 2026-02-25.6 — MySurf “Do Everything” Parity Pass
**Phase:** Full-surface MySurf completion in hub
**What happened:** Completed end-to-end MySurf parity expansion beyond CRUD stubs by implementing forecast, narrative, live conditions, map pinning, account/auth/profile, and richer spot-detail workflows in both web and mobile hub surfaces.
- Rebuilt `apps/web/app/surf` as a complete multi-route product surface:
  - shared shell nav: `apps/web/app/surf/components/SurfShell.tsx`
  - home: `apps/web/app/surf/page.tsx`
  - map + pinning + timeline scrubber: `apps/web/app/surf/map/page.tsx`
  - sessions journal: `apps/web/app/surf/sessions/page.tsx`
  - favorites surface: `apps/web/app/surf/favorites/page.tsx`
  - account/auth/preferences/premium controls: `apps/web/app/surf/account/page.tsx`
  - tabbed spot detail (Forecast/Analysis/Live/Charts/Guide): `apps/web/app/surf/spot/[id]/page.tsx`
- Replaced `apps/web/app/surf/actions.ts` with richer server action surface:
  - deterministic forecast/day-summary generation
  - regional + spot narrative generation and vote persistence
  - live buoy-condition synthesis
  - guide/hazard derivation
  - map pin CRUD persistence via hub preferences
  - local auth session/user/profile + settings persistence
  - automatic seed data initialization for first-run surf experience
- Restored and completed mobile MySurf module integration:
  - registry + stack route wiring in `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx`
  - migration map wiring in `apps/mobile/components/DatabaseProvider.tsx`
  - dependency registration in `apps/mobile/package.json`
  - full mobile surf route group:
    - `apps/mobile/app/(surf)/_layout.tsx`
    - `apps/mobile/app/(surf)/index.tsx`
    - `apps/mobile/app/(surf)/map.tsx`
    - `apps/mobile/app/(surf)/sessions.tsx`
    - `apps/mobile/app/(surf)/favorites.tsx`
    - `apps/mobile/app/(surf)/account.tsx`
    - `apps/mobile/app/(surf)/spot/[id].tsx`
- Reinstated missing web pages for currently enabled hub modules so type generation stayed consistent:
  - `apps/web/app/homes/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/workouts/page.tsx`

**Decision:** Implemented full MySurf feature behavior directly in hub runtime (SQLite + hub preferences) to achieve practical parity now, while keeping external provider-specific Phase 3/4 systems optional.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm install` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test` -> pass (23 files, 138 tests).
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test` -> pass (14 files, 36 tests).

### Entry 2026-02-25.7 — Web Default-Enable Bootstrap Bump for New Modules
**Phase:** Module rollout reliability
**What happened:** Updated web bootstrap preference key version from `web.bootstrap.enabled_modules.v2` to `web.bootstrap.enabled_modules.v3` so existing installs perform a one-time re-bootstrap and auto-enable newly added modules (including `MyWords`) by default.
- Updated `apps/web/app/actions.ts`
- Updated bootstrap preference assertions in `apps/web/app/__tests__/actions-enabled-modules.test.ts`

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run app/__tests__/actions-enabled-modules.test.ts` -> pass.

### Entry 2026-02-25.8 — Web Bootstrap Key Bump to v4 (Force Existing Installs to Include MyWords)
**Phase:** Existing-install bootstrap correction
**What happened:** Existing DBs had `web.bootstrap.enabled_modules.v3=1` with only 11 enabled modules, so `MyWords` remained excluded. Bumped bootstrap preference key to `v4` so current installs re-run one-time default enable pass and include all supported modules.
- Updated `apps/web/app/actions.ts` bootstrap key to `web.bootstrap.enabled_modules.v4`.
- Updated assertions in `apps/web/app/__tests__/actions-enabled-modules.test.ts`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run app/__tests__/actions-enabled-modules.test.ts` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web typecheck` -> pass.

### Entry 2026-02-25.9 — Option 2 Balanced Testing Platform Completed
**Phase:** Universal testing best-practices adoption
**What happened:** Completed the full “Balanced platform” rollout across the monorepo and stabilized coverage gates to pragmatic per-package baselines.
- Added shared Vitest baseline + deterministic test sequencing and UTC/fetch test guard:
  - `test/vitest/base.ts`
  - `test/vitest/setup.global.ts`
- Added shared DB test helpers/factories and exported them from `@mylife/db`:
  - `packages/db/src/test-utils.ts`
  - `packages/db/src/test-factories.ts`
  - `packages/db/src/index.ts`
- Refactored integration/unit suites to isolated fixture-style DB setup/teardown (not shared state), including web DB integration tests and module DB tests.
- Added package-level `test:coverage` scripts, Turbo `test:coverage` task, and package Vitest configs with explicit thresholds.
- Added CI workflow for lint/typecheck/test/coverage + conditional web e2e:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Fixed brittle module-registry constant assertion to prevent hardcoded module-count drift:
  - `packages/module-registry/src/__tests__/registry.test.ts`
- Finalized pragmatic coverage floors where needed to match current product surface breadth (`books`, `budget`, `mobile`, `web`) while preserving regression protection.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/module-registry test:coverage` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/books test:coverage` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/budget test:coverage` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test:coverage` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test:coverage` -> pass.
- `pnpm test:coverage` -> pass (`27 successful, 27 total`).

### Entry 2026-02-25.9 — MyWords Missing from UI Fixed (Reverted Runtime Files Restored)
**Phase:** Regression fix
**What happened:** Investigated persistent `11 modules active` state and found key runtime files had reverted to the 11-module configuration even though DB state included `words`.
- Restored `words` to runtime lists and routing:
  - `apps/web/lib/modules.ts` (`WEB_SUPPORTED_MODULE_IDS`)
  - `apps/web/components/Sidebar.tsx` (`MODULE_ROUTES.words`)
  - `apps/web/components/Providers.tsx` (register `WORDS_MODULE`)
  - `apps/web/lib/db.ts` (migrations map includes `words`)
- Restored registry definitions:
  - `packages/module-registry/src/types.ts` (`ModuleId` includes `words`)
  - `packages/module-registry/src/constants.ts` (`MODULE_IDS` + `MODULE_METADATA.words`)
- Restored visual/token + package wiring:
  - `packages/ui/src/tokens/colors.ts`
  - `apps/web/app/globals.css`
  - `apps/web/next.config.ts`
  - `apps/web/package.json`
- Recreated missing app/module files:
  - `modules/words/*`
  - `apps/web/app/words/*`

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/words typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/words test` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/module-registry typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/module-registry test` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run app/__tests__/actions-enabled-modules.test.ts app/__tests__/discover-page.test.tsx components/__tests__/sidebar.test.tsx` -> pass.
- Runtime checks:
  - `GET /words` returns `200`.
  - Headless browser text check confirms `MyWords` present and `12 modules active` on `/`.

### Entry 2026-02-25.10 — Mobile Module Parity Expansion (Hub-Wide Route + CRUD Coverage)
**Phase:** Mobile parity with hub/web module surface
**What happened:** Expanded the mobile hub from a partial module mount (`books`, `budget`, `surf`) to full module routing + feature coverage across all web-backed modules.
- Expanded mobile registry/migration wiring:
  - `apps/mobile/components/DatabaseProvider.tsx`
  - `apps/mobile/hooks/use-module-toggle.ts`
  - `apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx`
- Added missing module dependencies for mobile workspace package:
  - `apps/mobile/package.json`
- Updated hub discover catalog so `words` is discoverable on mobile:
  - `apps/mobile/app/(hub)/discover.tsx`
- Added new mobile module route groups and screens:
  - `apps/mobile/app/(fast)/*` (timer/history/stats/settings)
  - `apps/mobile/app/(recipes)/*`

- `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test` -> pass (15 files, 40 tests).

### Entry 2026-02-25.11 — Stronger Coverage Depth Ratchet (Books/Web/Mobile)
**Phase:** Testing depth hardening
**What happened:** Increased practical coverage depth by adding high-signal mobile module screen tests and then ratcheting package coverage floors upward to stronger, enforceable levels.
- Added new mobile screen tests for previously zero-coverage routes:
  - `apps/mobile/app/(car)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`
  - `apps/mobile/app/(habits)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`
  - `apps/mobile/app/(homes)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`
  - `apps/mobile/app/(meds)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`

  - `apps/mobile/app/(workouts)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`
  - `apps/mobile/app/(words)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`
- Improved mobile test primitives to support realistic list rendering paths:
  - `apps/mobile/test/setup.tsx` (`FlatList` mock now renders `ListHeaderComponent` and `ListEmptyComponent`)
- Raised package coverage thresholds to stronger baselines with headroom:
  - `modules/books/vitest.config.ts` -> lines/statements `50`, functions `95`, branches `65`
  - `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` -> lines/statements `46`, functions `50`, branches `60`
  - `apps/mobile/vitest.config.ts` -> lines/statements `38`, functions `65`, branches `60`

  - Mobile coverage now: lines/statements `39.81%`, functions `72.76%`, branches `73.12%`.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/books test:coverage` -> pass.
  - Books coverage: lines/statements `53.37%`, functions `97.1%`, branches `67.45%`.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test:coverage` -> pass.
  - Web coverage: lines/statements `47.39%`, functions `54.81%`, branches `68.46%`.

### Entry 2026-02-25.12 — Option 1+2 Completion: Mobile Fast/Subs/Surf + Web API Route Depth + Per-Folder Gates
**Phase:** Coverage depth ratchet
**What happened:** Completed targeted depth expansion for mobile `fast/subs/surf`, added key web API route tests (`identity`, `entitlements`, `access`), then introduced per-folder critical-path coverage thresholds while raising global package floors.

- Added mobile tests for previously untested module surfaces:
  - `apps/mobile/app/(fast)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`
  - `apps/mobile/app/(fast)/__tests__/history-stats.test.tsx`
  - `apps/mobile/app/(fast)/__tests__/settings.test.tsx`

  - `apps/web/app/api/access/bundle/download/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- Improved mobile test primitives:
  - `apps/mobile/test/setup.tsx` (added `Switch` mock, improved `Text` `onPress` handling, expanded module color tokens)
- Raised global thresholds + added per-folder critical-path thresholds:
  - `apps/mobile/vitest.config.ts`
  - `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
  - `modules/books/vitest.config.ts`

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test` -> pass (37 files, 79 tests).

### Entry 2026-02-25.13 — MyWords Completeness Pass + Standalone Verification
**Phase:** Words quality and isolation completion
**What happened:** Finished the richer MyWords result model rollout by closing the remaining mobile gaps and validating both the standalone `MyWords/` workspace and MyLife hub words module behavior.

- Mobile words screen now mirrors richer hub result sections:
  - Added `Chronology` and `Word Family` sections in `apps/mobile/app/(words)/index.tsx`.
  - Replaced static nearby words text with tappable chips that trigger direct lookup for the selected related word.
- Expanded tests to lock behavior:
  - Added nearby-word interaction test in `apps/mobile/app/(words)/__tests__/index.test.tsx`.
  - Extended `modules/words/src/__tests__/words.test.ts` to assert chronology and word-family enrichment.
- Re-verified standalone runtime (isolation track) and hub track checks.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/words test` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/mobile test -- "app/(words)/__tests__/index.test.tsx"` -> pass.
- `pnpm typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --dir MyWords typecheck` -> pass.

- Added MyLife app integration:
  - Mobile: reader tab and screens for upload + reading + note/highlight/bookmark workflows (`apps/mobile/app/(books)/reader/*`).
  - Web: new `/books/reader` and `/books/reader/[id]` pages plus server actions for reader CRUD in `apps/web/app/books/actions.ts`.
  - Updated books web subnav with a Reader entry.
- Added standalone MyBooks integration:
  - Shared package: reader schema migration `v2`, CRUD modules, parser exports, and DB tests.
  - Mobile: new Reader tab (`app/(tabs)/reader.tsx`) and document reader detail route (`app/reader/[id].tsx`).

- Added web integration:
  - New server action `suggestWordReplacementsAction` in `apps/web/app/words/actions.ts`.
  - Added a new `Word Helper` tab in `apps/web/app/words/page.tsx` with sentence input, selectable sentence words, replacement suggestions, and in-context preview sentences.
- Added module metadata updates so Word Helper is part of MyWords tab definitions in both runtime module definition and registry metadata:

- Updated parity docs:
  - `docs/standalone-parity-universal-implementation-plan.md` (MyWords web mode now `passthrough`).
  - `docs/standalone-parity-test-cases.md` (updated to 82 cases with budget/books/words passthrough enforcement entries).

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test:parity` -> pass (`82` tests).
- `pnpm check:parity` -> pass.

### Entry 2026-02-26.02 - MyBudget Web Passthrough Parity Conversion
**Phase:** Standalone parity hardening
**What happened:** Converted MyBudget web integration from adapter UI to strict standalone passthrough and added parity enforcement for wrapper + host wiring.

- Replaced hub `budget` web route implementation with a thin wrapper in `apps/web/app/budget/page.tsx`:

- `pnpm check:parity` -> pass.

### Entry 2026-02-25.17 — Fixed Turbopack Module-Not-Found for MyWorkouts Source Imports
**Phase:** MyLife web stability (standalone passthrough)
**What happened:** Resolved the workouts route build failures in MyLife caused by relative `*.js` imports/exports inside TypeScript source under the `MyWorkouts` submodule. Turbopack resolves source files directly and failed on paths like `./auth/index.js` when only `.ts` existed.

- Updated MyWorkouts source imports/exports to extensionless relative paths in:
  - `MyWorkouts/packages/shared/src/**`
  - `MyWorkouts/packages/supabase/src/**`
  - `MyWorkouts/packages/ui/src/index.ts`
- Confirmed no remaining relative `*.js` specifiers in MyWorkouts TS/TSX source.
- Verified MyLife workouts passthrough routes compile and load without module-not-found errors.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --dir MyWorkouts --filter @myworkouts/shared typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --dir MyWorkouts --filter @myworkouts/supabase typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --dir MyWorkouts --filter @myworkouts/ui typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --dir MyWorkouts --filter @myworkouts/web typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run test/parity/standalone-passthrough-matrix.test.ts` -> pass (82 tests).
- Route checks in running MyLife dev server:
  - `/workouts`
  - `/workouts/builder`
  - `/workouts/explore`
  - `/workouts/progress`
  - `/workouts/recordings`
  - `/workouts/recordings/1`
  - `/workouts/workout/1`
  - `/workouts/exercise/1`
  All returned HTTP `200` and no module-not-found overlays.

### Entry 2026-02-26.03 - MyWorkouts Invalid Exercise Route Auto-Recovery
**Phase:** MyLife web stability (workouts passthrough UX hardening)
**What happened:** Fixed the remaining broken-state flow where navigating to an invalid workouts exercise detail URL in MyLife showed a dead-end "Exercise not found" view.

- Updated `MyWorkouts/apps/web/app/exercise/[id]/page.tsx` to auto-recover invalid/missing exercise IDs:
  - Added guarded async fetch with cancellation safety.
  - On missing record or query error, route now `replace`s to `workoutsPath('/explore')`.
  - Replaced dead-end fallback message with a transient redirect state (`Redirecting to Explore...`) and manual fallback button.
- Kept hub route parity intact by changing only the standalone page used by passthrough wrappers.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --dir MyWorkouts --filter @myworkouts/web typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run test/parity/standalone-passthrough-matrix.test.ts` -> pass (82 tests).
- Browser validation (Playwright) against running MyLife dev server:
  - Visit `http://localhost:3000/workouts/exercise/1`
  - Auto-redirects to `http://localhost:3000/workouts/explore`
  - No "Exercise not found" text remains.

### Entry 2026-02-26.03 - Restored Rich MyWords UI on Web Passthrough
**Phase:** MyWords parity + UX restoration
**What happened:** Restored the previously shipped MyWords web experience (Search + Dictionary A-Z + Thesaurus A-Z + Word Helper + expanded lexical detail) by upgrading standalone MyWords source so passthrough keeps the richer UI.

- Replaced standalone web page `MyWords/apps/web/app/page.tsx` with the richer tabbed interface implementation used before passthrough.
- Extended standalone shared words domain to include parity APIs/features required by that UI:
  - Added `browseWordsAlphabetically` and `suggestWordReplacements`.
  - Added lookup enrichments/fields including `chronology` and `wordFamily`.
  - Added shared API modules under `MyWords/packages/shared/src/api/*` and split service/types (`service.ts`, `types.ts`).
- Updated standalone shared exports in `MyWords/packages/shared/src/index.ts` and added `zod` dependency in `MyWords/packages/shared/package.json`.
- Updated standalone web global tokens in `MyWords/apps/web/app/globals.css` to support the richer UI style variables.
- Fixed standalone mobile type safety after shared type expansion by guarding optional lookup fields in `MyWords/apps/mobile/app/index.tsx`.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --dir MyWords typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test:parity` -> pass (`82` tests).

### Entry 2026-02-26.04 - Fixed MyWorkouts Exercise Loading + Hub Visual Parity Shell
**Phase:** MyLife + standalone MyWorkouts parity hardening
**What happened:** Resolved exercise library loading failures in both standalone MyWorkouts and MyLife passthrough, and reduced visual mismatch in hub rendering.

- Added a built-in fallback exercise catalog in standalone shared package:
  - `MyWorkouts/packages/shared/src/exercise/catalog-seed.json` (seed dataset)
  - `MyWorkouts/packages/shared/src/exercise/catalog.ts` (`DEFAULT_EXERCISES`, `getDefaultExercises`)
  - Exported via `MyWorkouts/packages/shared/src/exercise/index.ts`
- Added resilient loader utility:
  - `MyWorkouts/apps/web/lib/exercises.ts`
  - Tries Supabase first; if empty/error/unauth, falls back to built-in catalog.
- Updated key pages to use resilient exercise loading:
  - `MyWorkouts/apps/web/app/explore/page.tsx` now uses explicit loading state and fallback catalog (no infinite "Loading exercises...").
  - `MyWorkouts/apps/web/app/workouts/builder/page.tsx` now hydrates from fallback catalog when Supabase is unavailable.
  - `MyWorkouts/apps/web/app/exercise/[id]/page.tsx` now resolves fallback exercise IDs before redirecting.
- Improved MyLife web visual parity for workouts routes:
  - Added `apps/web/app/workouts/layout.tsx` to render a light MyWorkouts shell with module-local nav, matching standalone styling direction while keeping hub sidebar.
- Build/type support updates:
  - `MyWorkouts/packages/shared/tsconfig.json` now includes JSON files.
  - `MyWorkouts/apps/web/tsconfig.json` now maps `@myworkouts/shared` to workspace source for correct type resolution.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm --dir MyWorkouts --filter @myworkouts/shared typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --dir MyWorkouts --filter @myworkouts/web typecheck` -> pass.
- `pnpm --filter @mylife/web test -- --run test/parity/standalone-passthrough-matrix.test.ts` -> pass (82 tests).
- Browser checks (Playwright):
  - `http://localhost:3001/explore` -> exercises render, not stuck loading.
  - `http://localhost:3000/workouts/explore` -> exercises render, not stuck loading.
  - `http://localhost:3000/workouts` -> light MyWorkouts shell present with module-local nav.

### Entry 2026-02-26.05 - MyBooks Web Passthrough Conversion + Strict Parity Gate
**Phase:** Standalone parity hardening (MyBooks)
**What happened:** Converted MyBooks web integration to passthrough wrappers and enforced strict wrapper + host wiring checks.

- Replaced MyLife books web runtime routes with thin passthrough wrappers:
  - `apps/web/app/books/layout.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/books/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/books/search/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/books/import/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/books/stats/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/books/reader/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/books/reader/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `apps/web/app/books/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added standalone canonical route surfaces in MyBooks to support direct host reuse:
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/layout.tsx`
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/page.tsx`
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/search/page.tsx`
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/import/page.tsx`
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/stats/page.tsx`
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/reader/page.tsx`
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/reader/[id]/page.tsx`
  - `MyBooks/apps/web/app/books/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added/verified host wiring for passthrough:
  - `apps/web/tsconfig.json` aliases for `@mybooks-web/*` and `@mybooks/shared`.
  - `apps/web/next.config.ts` transpilation for `@mybooks/shared` and `@mybooks/ui`.
- Updated parity declarations and strict checks:
  - `apps/web/test/parity/standalone-passthrough-matrix.test.ts` sets MyBooks web mode to `passthrough` and adds Books passthrough enforcement.
  - `scripts/check-passthrough-parity.mjs` adds Books inventory/content/wiring assertions.

**Verification:**
- `pnpm test:parity-matrix` -> pass (`82` tests).
- `pnpm check:passthrough-parity` -> pass.
- `node scripts/check-passthrough-parity.mjs` -> pass.
- `pnpm check:parity` -> pass.

**Next steps:**
1. Expand standalone MyBooks web so each `apps/web/app/books/**` route owns unique UI/behavior instead of temporary route-level re-exports.
2. Add route-specific MyBooks standalone tests for books web screens (`library`, `search`, `import`, `stats`, `reader`, `book detail`) and assert parity from hub wrappers.
3. Plan mobile passthrough conversion for MyBooks (`apps/mobile/app/(books)/**`) to move from `adapter` to `passthrough` mode.

### Entry 2026-02-26.06 - MyBooks Passthrough Commit + PR Handoff
**Phase:** Standalone parity hardening (handoff)
**What happened:** Landed an individual MyBooks passthrough commit on `feature/mysurf-full-parity` and published corresponding PR references.
