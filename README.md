# MyLife Hub

MyLife is the consolidated workspace for the family of personal apps.

Each app is intended to remain an independent Git repository with its own history and remote.
This repository primarily tracks app directories as submodules so the hub can evolve
without collapsing independent app ownership. Some new app directories may be local scaffolds
until their standalone repositories are initialized and linked.
